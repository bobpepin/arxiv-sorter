function is unknown except for a collection of ``offline" data examples. While
recent years have seen a flurry of work on applying various machine learning
techniques to the offline optimization problem, the majority of these work
focused on learning a surrogate of the unknown objective function and then
applying existing optimization algorithms. While the idea of modeling the
unknown objective function is intuitive and appealing, from the learning point
of view it also makes it very difficult to tune the objective of the learner
according to the objective of optimization. Instead of learning and then
optimizing the unknown objective function, in this paper we take on a less
intuitive but more direct view that optimization can be thought of as a process
of sampling from a generative model. To learn an effective generative model
from the offline data examples, we consider the standard technique of
``re-weighting", and our main technical contribution is a probably
approximately correct (PAC) lower bound on the natural optimization objective,
which allows us to jointly learn a weight function and a score-based generative
model. The robustly competitive performance of the proposed approach is
demonstrated via empirical studies using the standard offline optimization
benchmarks.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02019v1'>2401.02019v1</a></div>

sequential decision-making, recent work has considered smoothed online
learning, where the distribution of data at each time is assumed to have
bounded likeliehood ratio with respect to a base measure when conditioned on
the history. While previous works have demonstrated the benefits of smoothness,
they have either assumed that the base measure is known to the learner or have
presented computationally inefficient algorithms applying only in special
cases. This work investigates the more general setting where the base measure
is \emph{unknown} to the learner, focusing in particular on the performance of
Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) with square loss when the data are
well-specified and smooth. We show that in this setting, ERM is able to achieve
sublinear error whenever a class is learnable with iid data; in particular, ERM
achieves error scaling as $\tilde O( \sqrt{\mathrm{comp}(\mathcal F)\cdot T}
)$, where $\mathrm{comp}(\mathcal F)$ is the statistical complexity of learning
$\mathcal F$ with iid data. In so doing, we prove a novel norm comparison bound
for smoothed data that comprises the first sharp norm comparison for dependent
data applying to arbitrary, nonlinear function classes. We complement these
results with a lower bound indicating that our analysis of ERM is essentially
tight, establishing a separation in the performance of ERM between smoothed and
iid data.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14987v1'>2402.14987v1</a></div>

loss functions defined on pairs of training examples, including those in metric
learning and AUC maximization. Acknowledging the quadratic growth in
computation complexity accompanying pairwise loss as the sample size grows,
researchers have turned to online gradient descent (OGD) methods for enhanced
scalability. Recently, an OGD algorithm emerged, employing gradient computation
involving prior and most recent examples, a step that effectively reduces
algorithmic complexity to $O(T)$, with $T$ being the number of received
examples. This approach, however, confines itself to linear models while
assuming the independence of example arrivals. We introduce a lightweight OGD
algorithm that does not require the independence of examples and generalizes to
kernel pairwise learning. Our algorithm builds the gradient based on a random
example and a moving average representing the past data, which results in a
sub-linear regret bound with a complexity of $O(T)$. Furthermore, through the
integration of $O(\sqrt{T}{\log{T}})$ random Fourier features, the complexity
of kernel calculations is effectively minimized. Several experiments with
real-world datasets show that the proposed technique outperforms kernel and

consider three types of learners, depending on the level of side-information

the domain $\mathbb{R}^n$, proving that non-trivial transfer learning for
low-degree polynomials is possible under very mild assumptions, going well
beyond the classical assumption that $dQ/dP$ is bounded. For instance, it
always applies if $Q$ is a log-concave measure and the inverse ratio $dP/dQ$ is
bounded. To demonstrate the applicability of our inequality, we obtain new
results in the settings of: (1) the classical truncated regression setting,
where $dQ/dP$ equals infinity, and (2) the more recent out-of-distribution

the bilinear and strongly convex-strongly concave settings and assess its

case study for complex loss landscapes. We first study the high-dimensional
limit where both the number $M$ and the dimension $N$ of the data are going to
infinity at fixed signal-to-noise ratio $\alpha = M/N$. By analyzing how the
local curvature changes during optimization, we uncover that for intermediate
$\alpha$, the Hessian displays a downward direction pointing towards good
minima in the first regime of the descent, before being trapped in bad minima
at the end. Hence, the local landscape is benign and informative at first,
before gradient descent brings the system into a uninformative maze. The
transition between the two regimes is associated to a BBP-type threshold in the
time-dependent Hessian. Through both theoretical analysis and numerical
experiments, we show that in practical cases, i.e. for finite but even very
large $N$, successful optimization via gradient descent in phase retrieval is
achieved by falling towards the good minima before reaching the bad ones. This
mechanism explains why successful recovery is obtained well before the
algorithmic transition corresponding to the high-dimensional limit.
Technically, this is associated to strong logarithmic corrections of the
algorithmic transition at large $N$ with respect to the one expected in the

high-probability generalization bounds for heavy-tailed SDEs which do not

SGD in the vicinity of a stationary point as a predictive proxy for sharpness
and generalization error in overparameterized neural networks (Wu et al., 2022;
Jastrzebski et al., 2019; Cohen et al., 2021). In this paper, we delve deeper
into the relationship between linear stability and sharpness. More
specifically, we meticulously delineate the necessary and sufficient conditions
for linear stability, contingent on hyperparameters of SGD and the sharpness at
the optimum. Towards this end, we introduce a novel coherence measure of the
loss Hessian that encapsulates pertinent geometric properties of the loss
function that are relevant to the linear stability of SGD. It enables us to
provide a simplified sufficient condition for identifying linear instability at
an optimum. Notably, compared to previous works, our analysis relies on
significantly milder assumptions and is applicable for a broader class of loss

feed-forward neural networks. Unlike existing approaches that are based on
back-propagation (BP) and chain rule gradient-based optimization (which implies
iterative execution, potentially burdensome and time-consuming in some cases),
the proposed approach offers the solution for weight optimization in
closed-form by means of least squares (LS) methodology. In the case where the
input-to-output mapping is injective, the new approach optimizes the weights in
a back-propagating fashion in a single iteration by jointly optimizing a set of
weights in each layer for each neuron. In the case where the input-to-output
mapping is not injective (e.g., in classification problems), the proposed
solution is easily adapted to obtain its final solution in a few iterations. An
important advantage over the existing solutions is that these computations (for
all neurons in a layer) are independent from each other; thus, they can be
carried out in parallel to optimize all weights in a given layer
simultaneously. Furthermore, its running time is deterministic in the sense
that one can obtain the exact number of computations necessary to optimize the
weights in all network layers (per iteration, in the case of non-injective
mapping). Our simulation and empirical results show that the proposed scheme,
BPLS, works well and is competitive with existing ones in terms of accuracy,

Standard Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINN) takes into account the
governing physical laws described by PDE during the learning process. The
network is trained on a data set that consists of randomly selected points in
the physical domain and its boundary. PINNs have been successfully applied to
solve various problems described by PDEs with boundary conditions. The loss
function in traditional PINNs is based on the strong residuals of the PDEs.
This loss function in PINNs is generally not robust with respect to the true
error. The loss function in PINNs can be far from the true error, which makes
the training process more difficult. In particular, we do not know if the
training process has already converged to the solution with the required
accuracy. This is especially true if we do not know the exact solution, so we
cannot estimate the true error during the training. This paper introduces a
different way of defining the loss function. It incorporates the residual and
the inverse of the Gram matrix, computed using the energy norm. We test our
RPINN algorithm on two Laplace problems and one advection-diffusion problem in
two spatial dimensions. We conclude that RPINN is a robust method. The proposed
loss coincides well with the true error of the solution, as measured in the
energy norm. Thus, we know if our training process goes well, and we know when
to stop the training to obtain the neural network approximation of the solution
of the PDE with the true error of required accuracy.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02300v2'>2401.02300v2</a></div>

In this work, we use Stein variational gradient descent, a recently proposed
algorithm for approximating intractable distributions that overcomes the
drawbacks of the aforementioned techniques. In particular, we show through
experimental studies on simulated run-to-failure turbofan engine degradation
data that Bayesian deep learning models trained via Stein variational gradient
descent consistently outperform with respect to convergence speed and
predictive performance both the same models trained via parametric variational
inference and their frequentist counterparts trained via backpropagation.
Furthermore, we propose a method to enhance performance based on the

and linear fractional stable motions (lfsm). The work involves a fast
generation of extensive datasets for fBm and fOU to train the LSTM network on a

network architecture conserves the Hamiltonian, which defines the acceptance
criteria of the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampler. Hence, this strategy achieves
high acceptance rates at low computational cost. Our approach estimates small
failure probabilities using Subset Simulations. However, in low-probability
sample regions, the gradient evaluation is particularly challenging. The
remarkable accuracy of the proposed strategy is demonstrated on different
reliability problems, and its efficiency is compared to the traditional

the probability of failure. The highlight of this study is the reliability
analysis of a system whose parameter distributions must be inferred with
Bayesian inference problems. In such a case, the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method
requires a full model evaluation for each gradient evaluation and, therefore,
comes at a very high cost. However, using Hamiltonian neural networks in this

improve training efficiency and to enable control of the approximation error,
the network mimics an adaptive finite element method (AFEM). It outputs a
coarse grid solution and a series of corrections as produced in an AFEM,
allowing a tracking of the error decay over successive layers of the network.
The observed errors are measured by a reliable residual based a posteriori
error estimator, enabling the reduction to only few parameters for the

representation of the solution on locally refined grids. Furthermore, each
solution of the AFEM is discretized in a hierarchical basis. For the

basis then allows to handle sparse images for finely discretized meshes.
Additionally, as corrections on finer levels decrease in amplitude, i.e.,
importance for the overall approximation, the accuracy of the network

incorporated in the number of generated high fidelity samples used for training

The pre-trained NN blocks learn specific local features during the offline

While such constraints can be softly imposed via loss function penalties,
recent advancements in differentiable physics and optimization improve
performance by incorporating PDE-constrained optimization as individual layers
in neural networks. This enables a stricter adherence to physical constraints.
However, imposing hard constraints significantly increases computational and
memory costs, especially for complex dynamical systems. This is because it
requires solving an optimization problem over a large number of points in a
mesh, representing spatial and temporal discretizations, which greatly
increases the complexity of the constraint. To address this challenge, we
develop a scalable approach to enforce hard physical constraints using
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), which can be used with any neural network
architecture. Our approach imposes the constraint over smaller decomposed
domains, each of which is solved by an "expert" through differentiable
optimization. During training, each expert independently performs a localized
backpropagation step by leveraging the implicit function theorem; the
independence of each expert allows for parallelization across multiple GPUs.
Compared to standard differentiable optimization, our scalable approach
achieves greater accuracy in the neural PDE solver setting for predicting the

be remarkably challenging, and the models available to achieve it tend to be
highly specialized and complex too. In this work we propose a novel supervised
learning framework for zero-shot inference of ODEs from noisy data. We first
generate large datasets of one-dimensional ODEs, by sampling distributions over
the space of initial conditions, and the space of vector fields defining them.
We then learn neural maps between noisy observations on the solutions of these
equations, and their corresponding initial condition and vector fields. The
resulting models, which we call foundational inference models (FIM), can be (i)
copied and matched along the time dimension to increase their resolution; and
(ii) copied and composed to build inference models of any dimensionality,
without the need of any finetuning. We use FIM to model both ground-truth
dynamical systems of different dimensionalities and empirical time series data
in a zero-shot fashion, and outperform state-of-the-art models which are
finetuned to these systems. Our (pretrained) FIMs are available online</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07594v1'>2402.07594v1</a></div>

manifolds is designed such that the state of the observer is restricted to the
Lie group on which the system evolves. Conventional techniques involving
machine learning based observers on systems evolving on Lie groups involve
designing charts for the Lie group, training a machine learning based observer
for each chart, and switching between the trained models based on the state of
the system. We propose a novel deep learning based technique whose predictions
are restricted to a measure 0 subset of Euclidean space without using charts.
Using this network, we design an observer ensuring that the state of the
observer is restricted to the Lie group, and predicting the state using only
one trained algorithm. The deep learning network predicts an ``error term'' on
the Lie algebra of the Lie group, uses the map from the Lie algebra to the
group, and uses the group action and the present state to estimate the state at
the next epoch. This model being purely data driven does not require the model
of the system. The proposed algorithm provides a novel framework for
constraining the output of machine learning networks to a measure 0 subset of a
Euclidean space without chart specific training and without requiring
switching. We show the validity of this method using Monte Carlo simulations
performed of the rigid body rotation and translation system.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11196v1'>2401.11196v1</a></div>

many machine learning fields, such as in image-based learning models,
reinforcement learning for self driving vehicles, and general noise injection
for point cloud data. However, convincing methods for general time series data
augmentation still leaves much to be desired, especially since the methods
developed for these models do not readily cross-over. Three common approaches
for time series data augmentation include: (i) Constructing a physics-based
model and then imbuing uncertainty over the coefficient space (for example),
(ii) Adding noise to the observed data set(s), and, (iii) Having access to
ample amounts of time series data sets from which a robust generative neural
network model can be trained. However, for many practical problems that work
with time series data in the industry: (i) One usually does not have access to
a robust physical model, (ii) The addition of noise can in of itself require
large or difficult assumptions (for example, what probability distribution
should be used? Or, how large should the noise variance be?), and, (iii) In
practice, it can be difficult to source a large representative time series data
base with which to train the neural network model for the underlying problem.
In this paper, we propose a methodology which attempts to simultaneously tackle
all three of these previous limitations to a large extent. The method relies
upon the well-studied matrix differential geometry of the Stiefel manifold, as
it proposes a simple way in which time series signals can placed on, and then
smoothly perturbed over the manifold. We attempt to clarify how this method
works by showcasing several potential use cases which in particular work to
take advantage of the unique properties of this underlying manifold.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19287v1'>2402.19287v1</a></div>

However, one of the major challenges of physics-constrained neural networks
consists of the training complexity especially for high-dimensional systems. In
fact, conventional physics-constrained models rely on singular-fidelity data
necessitating the assessment of physical constraints within high-dimensional
fields, which introduces computational difficulties. Furthermore, due to the
fixed input size of the neural networks, employing multi-fidelity training data
can also be cumbersome. In this paper, we propose the Multi-Scale
Physics-Constrained Neural Network (MSPCNN), which offers a novel methodology
for incorporating data with different levels of fidelity into a unified latent

decoders are concurrently trained to map latent representations of inputs into
various fidelity physical spaces. As a result, during the training of
predictive models, physical constraints can be evaluated within low-fidelity
spaces, yielding a trade-off between training efficiency and accuracy. In
addition, unlike conventional methods, MSPCNN also manages to employ
multi-fidelity data to train the predictive model. We assess the performance of
MSPCNN in two fluid dynamics problems, namely a two-dimensional Burgers' system
and a shallow water system. Numerical results clearly demonstrate the
enhancement of prediction accuracy and noise robustness when introducing
physical constraints in low-fidelity fields. On the other hand, as expected,
the training complexity can be significantly reduced by computing physical

long-standing question in numerical analysis. Herein, we employ neural
operators to solve Riemann problems encountered in compressible flows for
extreme pressure jumps (up to $10^{10}$ pressure ratio). In particular, we
first consider the DeepONet that we train in a two-stage process, following the
recent work of Lee and Shin, wherein the first stage, a basis is extracted from
the trunk net, which is orthonormalized and subsequently is used in the second
stage in training the branch net. This simple modification of DeepONet has a
profound effect on its accuracy, efficiency, and robustness and leads to very
accurate solutions to Riemann problems compared to the vanilla version. It also
enables us to interpret the results physically as the hierarchical data-driven
produced basis reflects all the flow features that would otherwise be
introduced using ad hoc feature expansion layers. We also compare the results
with another neural operator based on the U-Net for low, intermediate, and very
high-pressure ratios that are very accurate for Riemann problems, especially
for large pressure ratios, due to their multiscale nature but computationally
more expensive. Overall, our study demonstrates that simple neural network

Recent advances in the deep learning community also enables to adress this

use a stochastic PDE as surrogate model along the data assimilation window. The
training involves a loss function for both reconstruction task and SPDE prior

methods mainly process the flow images in natural image patterns, while the
critical and distinct flow visual properties are rarely considered. This
negligence would cause the significant domain gap between flow and natural
images to severely hamper the accurate perception of flow turbulence, thereby
undermining super-resolution performance. To tackle this dilemma, we
comprehensively consider the flow visual properties, including the unique flow
imaging principle and morphological information, and propose the first flow
visual property-informed FISR algorithm. Particularly, different from natural
images that are constructed by independent RGB channels in the light field,
flow images build on the orthogonal UVW velocities in the flow field. To
empower the FISR network with an awareness of the flow imaging principle, we
propose quaternion spatial modeling to model this orthogonal spatial
relationship for improved FISR. Moreover, due to viscosity and surface tension
characteristics, fluids often exhibit a droplet-like morphology in flow images.
Inspired by this morphological property, we design the dynamic flow convolution
to effectively mine the morphological information to enhance FISR. Extensive
experiments on the newly acquired flow image datasets demonstrate the
state-of-the-art performance of our method. Code and data will be made

fully differentiable unrolling, we include a third, less widely used variant:
unrolling without temporal gradients. Comparing networks trained with these
three modalities makes it possible to disentangle the two dominant effects of
unrolling, training distribution shift and long-term gradients. We present a
detailed study across physical systems, network sizes, network architectures,
training setups, and test scenarios. It provides an empirical basis for our
main findings: A non-differentiable but unrolled training setup supported by a
numerical solver can yield 4.5-fold improvements over a fully differentiable
prediction setup that does not utilize this solver. We also quantify a
difference in the accuracy of models trained in a fully differentiable setup
compared to their non-differentiable counterparts. While differentiable setups
perform best, the accuracy of unrolling without temporal gradients comes
comparatively close. Furthermore, we empirically show that these behaviors are
invariant to changes in the underlying physical system, the network
architecture and size, and the numerical scheme. These results motivate
integrating non-differentiable numerical simulators into training setups even

parametric systems. There are lack of strategies for solving parametric systems
governed by PDEs that involve explicit and implicit quantities. In this paper,
a deep learning-based Multi Physics-Informed PointNet (MPIPN) is proposed for

such problems using state-of-the-art high-fidelity models require significant
computational effort. Conventional data-driven surrogate modeling approaches
create low-dimensional embeddings for evolving the dynamics in order to
circumvent this computational effort. Most approaches directly operate on
high-resolution data obtained from numerical discretization, which is both
costly and complicated for mapping the flow of information over large spatial
distances. Furthermore, working with a fixed resolution prevents the adaptation
of surrogate models to environments with variable computing capacities,
different visualization resolutions, and different accuracy requirements. We
thus propose a multi-hierarchical framework for structurally creating a series
of surrogate models for a kart frame, which is a good proxy for
industrial-relevant crash simulations, at different levels of resolution. For
multiscale phenomena, macroscale features are captured on a coarse surrogate,
whereas microscale effects are resolved by finer ones. The learned behavior of
the individual surrogates is passed from coarse to finer levels through
transfer learning. In detail, we perform a mesh simplification on the kart
model to obtain multi-resolution representations of it. We then train a
graph-convolutional neural network-based surrogate that learns
parameter-dependent low-dimensional latent dynamics on the coarsest
representation. Subsequently, another, similarly structured surrogate is
trained on the residual of the first surrogate using a finer resolution. This
step can be repeated multiple times. By doing so, we construct multiple

order to bridge the gap between microscale stochastic fluid models and
continuum-based fluid models for bubble dynamics, we develop a composite neural

Training and testing data are generated by conducting mDPD and RP simulations
for nonlinear bubble dynamics with initial bubble radii ranging from 0.1 to 1.5

accurately predict bubble dynamics across scales, with a 99% accuracy for the

relevant solution for a system of conservation laws, thus motivating the
construction of entropy stable schemes that satisfy a discrete analogue of such

high-order entropy stable finite difference solvers, which require specialized
reconstruction algorithms satisfying the sign property at each cell interface.
Recently, third-order WENO schemes called SP-WENO (Fjordholm and Ray, 2016) and
SP-WENOc (Ray, 2018) have been designed to satisfy the sign property. However,
these WENO algorithms can perform poorly near shocks, with the numerical
solutions exhibiting large spurious oscillations. In the present work, we
propose a variant of the SP-WENO, termed as Deep Sign-Preserving WENO
(DSP-WENO), where a neural network is trained to learn the WENO weighting
strategy. The sign property and third-order accuracy are strongly imposed in
the algorithm, which constrains the WENO weight selection region to a convex
polygon. Thereafter, a neural network is trained to select the WENO weights
from this convex region with the goal of improving the shock-capturing
capabilities without sacrificing the rate of convergence in smooth regions. The
proposed synergistic approach retains the mathematical framework of the TeCNO

capture local features but are limited to training and inference at a single

that can capture local features under two frameworks by learning differential

the two continua aligns with that used in the Dual-porosity model but with a

accurately using concurrent multiscale models than with single-scale

application of this approach. The costs originate from microscale Finite
Element (FE) models that must be solved at every macroscopic integration point.
A plethora of surrogate modeling strategies attempt to alleviate this cost by
learning to predict macroscopic stresses from macroscopic strains, completely
replacing the microscale models. In this work, we introduce an alternative
surrogate modeling strategy that allows for keeping the multiscale nature of
the problem, allowing it to be used interchangeably with an FE solver for any

homogenized to obtain macroscopic quantities of interest. We achieve this for
an elasto-plastic material by predicting full-field microscopic strains using a
graph neural network (GNN) while retaining the microscopic constitutive
material model to obtain the stresses. This hybrid data-physics graph-based
approach avoids the high dimensionality originating from predicting full-field
responses while allowing non-locality to arise. By training the GNN on a
variety of meshes, it learns to generalize to unseen meshes, allowing a single
model to be used for a range of microstructures. The embedded microscopic
constitutive model in the GNN implicitly tracks history-dependent variables and
leads to improved accuracy. We demonstrate for several challenging scenarios

modeling of physical systems, employing inference techniques and machine

of cathodic electrophoretic deposition (EPD), commonly known as e-coating. Our
approach illustrates a systematic procedure for enhancing physical models by
identifying their limitations through inference on experimental data and
introducing adaptable model enhancements to address these shortcomings. We
begin by tackling the issue of model parameter identifiability, which reveals
aspects of the model that require improvement. To address generalizability , we
introduce modifications which also enhance identifiability. However, these
modifications do not fully capture essential experimental behaviors. To
overcome this limitation, we incorporate interpretable yet flexible
augmentations into the baseline model. These augmentations are parameterized by
simple fully-connected neural networks (FNNs), and we leverage machine learning
tools, particularly Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs), to
learn these augmentations. Our simulations demonstrate that the machine
learning-augmented model more accurately captures observed behaviors and
improves predictive accuracy. Nevertheless, we contend that while the model
updates offer superior performance and capture the relevant physics, we can
reduce off-line computational costs by eliminating certain dynamics without
compromising accuracy or interpretability in downstream predictions of
quantities of interest, particularly film thickness predictions. The entire
process outlined here provides a structured approach to leverage data-driven

directly outputs a Boundary representation (B-rep) Computer-Aided Design (CAD)
model. BrepGen represents a B-rep model as a novel structured latent geometry
in a hierarchical tree. With the root node representing a whole CAD solid, each
element of a B-rep model (i.e., a face, an edge, or a vertex) progressively
turns into a child-node from top to bottom. B-rep geometry information goes
into the nodes as the global bounding box of each primitive along with a latent
code describing the local geometric shape. The B-rep topology information is
implicitly represented by node duplication. When two faces share an edge, the
edge curve will appear twice in the tree, and a T-junction vertex with three
incident edges appears six times in the tree with identical node features.
Starting from the root and progressing to the leaf, BrepGen employs
Transformer-based diffusion models to sequentially denoise node features while
duplicated nodes are detected and merged, recovering the B-Rep topology
information. Extensive experiments show that BrepGen sets a new milestone in
CAD B-rep generation, surpassing existing methods on various benchmarks.
Results on our newly collected furniture dataset further showcase its

Additional applications of BrepGen include CAD autocomplete and design

resolutions, multimodal signals from real-world processes and systems that
exhibit diverse transient, nonlinear stochastic dynamics, such as manufacturing
machines. It is based on discerning and synchronizing the process signatures of
salient kinematic and dynamic events in these disparate signals. HiRA-Pro
addresses the challenge of aligning data with sub-millisecond phenomena, where
traditional timestamp, external trigger, or clock-based alignment methods fall
short. The effectiveness of HiRA-Pro is demonstrated in a smart manufacturing
context, where it aligns data from 13+ channels acquired during 3D-printing and
milling operations on an Optomec-LENS MTS 500 hybrid machine. The aligned data
is then voxelized to generate 0.25 second aligned data chunks that correspond
to physical voxels on the produced part. The superiority of HiRA-Pro is further
showcased through case studies in additive manufacturing, demonstrating
improved machine learning-based predictive performance due to precise
multimodal data alignment. Specifically, testing classification accuracies
improved by almost 35% with the application of HiRA-Pro, even with limited
data, allowing for precise localization of artifacts. The paper also provides a
comprehensive discussion on the proposed method, its applications, and
comparative qualitative analysis with a few other alignment methods. HiRA-Pro
achieves temporal-spatial resolutions of 10-1000 us and 100 um in order to
generate datasets that register with physical voxels on the 3D-printed and
milled part. These resolutions are at least an order of magnitude finer than
the existing alignment methods that employ individual timestamps, statistical
correlations, or common clocks, which achieve precision of hundreds of
milliseconds.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06888v2'>2403.06888v2</a></div>

libraries that can be explored in multiple locations by multiple tools
simultaneously, or downstream characterization in automated synthesis systems.
In the co-orchestration approaches, information gained in one modality should
accelerate the discovery of other modalities. Correspondingly, the
orchestrating agent should select the measurement modality based on the
anticipated knowledge gain and measurement cost. Here, we propose and implement
a co-orchestration approach for conducting measurements with complex
observables such as spectra or images. The method relies on combining
dimensionality reduction by variational autoencoders with representation
learning for control over the latent space structure, and integrated into
iterative workflow via multi-task Gaussian Processes (GP). This approach
further allows for the native incorporation of the system's physics via a
probabilistic model as a mean function of the GP. We illustrated this method
for different modalities of piezoresponse force microscopy and micro-Raman on
combinatorial $Sm-BiFeO_3$ library. However, the proposed framework is general
and can be extended to multiple measurement modalities and arbitrary

a novel process control and monitoring method for the complex structure of
high-dimensional image-based overlay errors (modeled in tensor form), which are
collected in semiconductor manufacturing processes. The proposed method aims to
reduce overlay errors using limited control recipes. We first build a
high-dimensional process model and propose different tensor-on-vector
regression algorithms to estimate parameters in the model to alleviate the
curse of dimensionality. Then, based on the estimate of tensor parameters, the
exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) controller for tensor data is
designed whose stability is theoretically guaranteed. Considering the fact that
low-dimensional control recipes cannot compensate for all high-dimensional
disturbances on the image, control residuals are monitored to prevent
significant drifts of uncontrollable high-dimensional disturbances. Through
extensive simulations and real case studies, the performances of parameter
estimation algorithms and the EWMA controller in tensor space are evaluated.

a gain-scheduling (GS) nonlinear design is the simplest approach to the design
of nonlinear feedback. The GS version of PDE backstepping employs gains
obtained by solving a PDE at each value of the state. Performing such PDE
computations in real time may be prohibitive. The recently introduced neural

variety of reasons. First, it comes with a rich mathematical structure to
account for a wide range of non-linear geometries that has been shown to be
able to capture the data geometry through empirical evidence from classical
non-linear embedding. Second, many standard data analysis tools initially
developed for data in Euclidean space can also be generalised efficiently to
data on a symmetric Riemannian manifold. A conceptual challenge comes from the
lack of guidelines for constructing a symmetric Riemannian structure on the
data space itself and the lack of guidelines for modifying successful
algorithms on symmetric Riemannian manifolds for data analysis to this setting.
This work considers these challenges in the setting of pullback Riemannian
geometry through a diffeomorphism. The first part of the paper characterises
diffeomorphisms that result in proper, stable and efficient data analysis. The
second part then uses these best practices to guide construction of such
diffeomorphisms through deep learning. As a proof of concept, different types
of pullback geometries -- among which the proposed construction -- are tested
on several data analysis tasks and on several toy data sets. The numerical
experiments confirm the predictions from theory, i.e., that the diffeomorphisms
generating the pullback geometry need to map the data manifold into a geodesic
subspace of the pulled back Riemannian manifold while preserving local isometry
around the data manifold for proper, stable and efficient data analysis, and
that pulling back positive curvature can be problematic in terms of stability.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06612v1'>2403.06612v1</a></div>

obtain equivariant MLPs (EMLPs). But this method does not scale well and
scaling is crucial in deep learning. Here, we introduce Group Representation
Networks (G-RepsNets), a lightweight equivariant network for arbitrary matrix
groups with features represented using tensor polynomials. The key intuition
for our design is that using tensor representations in the hidden layers of a

expressive universal equivariant networks. We find G-RepsNet to be competitive

shape, have emerged as a powerful representation for many applications, e.g.,
encoding a 3D shape and performing collision detection. Typically, implicit
fields are encoded by Multi-layer Perceptrons (MLP) with positional encoding
(PE) to capture high-frequency geometric details. However, a notable side
effect of such PE-equipped MLPs is the noisy artifacts present in the learned
implicit fields. While increasing the sampling rate could in general mitigate
these artifacts, in this paper we aim to explain this adverse phenomenon
through the lens of Fourier analysis. We devise a tool to determine the
appropriate sampling rate for learning an accurate neural implicit field
without undesirable side effects. Specifically, we propose a simple yet
effective method to estimate the intrinsic frequency of a given network with
randomized weights based on the Fourier analysis of the network's responses. It
is observed that a PE-equipped MLP has an intrinsic frequency much higher than
the highest frequency component in the PE layer. Sampling against this
intrinsic frequency following the Nyquist-Sannon sampling theorem allows us to
determine an appropriate training sampling rate. We empirically show in the
setting of SDF fitting that this recommended sampling rate is sufficient to
secure accurate fitting results, while further increasing the sampling rate
would not further noticeably reduce the fitting error. Training PE-equipped
MLPs simply with our sampling strategy leads to performances superior to the
existing methods.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01391v1'>2401.01391v1</a></div>

reduction and visualization by modeling the function that maps a spatial

visualization tasks like iso-surface extraction which can be very
computationally expensive. Recently, range analysis has shown promising results
in improving the efficiency of geometric queries, such as ray casting and
hierarchical mesh extraction, on INRs for 3D geometries by using arithmetic
rules to bound the output range of the network within a spatial region.
However, the analysis bounds are often too conservative for complex scientific
data. In this paper, we present an improved technique for range analysis by
revisiting the arithmetic rules and analyzing the probability distribution of
the network output within a spatial region. We model this distribution
efficiently as a Gaussian distribution by applying the central limit theorem.
Excluding low probability values, we are able to tighten the output bounds,
resulting in a more accurate estimation of the value range, and hence more
accurate identification of iso-surface cells and more efficient iso-surface

free streaming limit that we derived in our paper on closures in transport
\cite{Huang2022-RTE1}. The exact closure relates the gradient of the highest
moment to the gradient of four lower moments. As with our past work, the model
presented here learns the gradient of the highest moment in terms of the
coefficients of gradients for all lower ones. By necessity, this means that the
resulting hyperbolic system is not conservative in the highest moment. For
stability, the output layers of the NN are designed to enforce hyperbolicity
and Galilean invariance. This ensures the model can be run outside of the
training window of the NN. Unlike our previous work on radiation transport that
dealt with linear models, the BGK model's nonlinearity demanded advanced
training tools. These comprised an optimal learning rate discovery, one cycle
training, batch normalization in each neural layer, and the use of the
\texttt{AdamW} optimizer. To address the non-conservative structure of the

over classical solvers in terms of speed, often achieving speedups of 10 to
1000 times over traditional partial differential equation (PDE) solvers.
However, a significant challenge hindering their widespread adoption in both
scientific and industrial domains is the lack of understanding about their
prediction uncertainties, particularly in scenarios that involve critical
decision making. To address this limitation, we propose a method that
integrates efficient and precise uncertainty quantification into a deep
learning-based surrogate model. Our method, termed Latent Evolution of PDEs
with Uncertainty Quantification (LE-PDE-UQ), endows deep learning-based
surrogate models with robust and efficient uncertainty quantification
capabilities for both forward and inverse problems. LE-PDE-UQ leverages latent
vectors within a latent space to evolve both the system's state and its
corresponding uncertainty estimation. The latent vectors are decoded to provide
predictions for the system's state as well as estimates of its uncertainty. In
extensive experiments, we demonstrate the accurate uncertainty quantification
performance of our approach, surpassing that of strong baselines including deep
ensembles, Bayesian neural network layers, and dropout. Our method excels at
propagating uncertainty over extended auto-regressive rollouts, making it
suitable for scenarios involving long-term predictions. Our code is available

Conditional Latent Autoregressive Recurrent Model (CLARM) for learning the
spatiotemporal dynamics of charged particles in accelerators. CLARM consists of
a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) transforming six-dimensional phase

CLARM can generate projections at various accelerator modules by sampling and
decoding the latent space representation. The model also forecasts future

possesses a unique capability: it seamlessly integrates SciML into UQ and vice

and leverage SciML for improved uncertainty assessment during UQ-related tasks.
The proposed surrogate model can effectively incorporate a variety of physical
constraints, such as governing partial differential equations (PDEs) with
associated initial and boundary conditions constraints, inequality-type
constraints (e.g., monotonicity, convexity, non-negativity, among others), and
additional a priori information in the training process to supplement limited

the need for expensive computational model evaluations to train the surrogate
model. Furthermore, the proposed method has a built-in uncertainty
quantification (UQ) feature to efficiently estimate output uncertainties. To
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we apply it to a diverse
set of problems, including linear/non-linear PDEs with deterministic and
stochastic parameters, data-driven surrogate modeling of a complex physical

employed for simulating physical systems. However, the computational cost
remains a major bottleneck in various scientific and engineering applications,
which has motivated the development of reduced-order models (ROMs). Recently,
machine-learning-based ROMs have gained significant popularity and are
promising for addressing some limitations of traditional ROM methods,
especially for advection dominated systems. In this chapter, we focus on a
particular framework known as Latent Space Dynamics Identification (LaSDI),
which transforms the high-fidelity data, governed by a PDE, to simpler and
low-dimensional latent-space data, governed by ordinary differential equations
(ODEs). These ODEs can be learned and subsequently interpolated to make ROM
predictions. Each building block of LaSDI can be easily modulated depending on
the application, which makes the LaSDI framework highly flexible. In
particular, we present strategies to enforce the laws of thermodynamics into
LaSDI models (tLaSDI), enhance robustness in the presence of noise through the
weak form (WLaSDI), select high-fidelity training data efficiently through
active learning (gLaSDI, GPLaSDI), and quantify the ROM prediction uncertainty
through Gaussian processes (GPLaSDI). We demonstrate the performance of
different LaSDI approaches on Burgers equation, a non-linear heat conduction
problem, and a plasma physics problem, showing that LaSDI algorithms can
achieve relative errors of less than a few percent and up to thousands of times
speed-ups.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10748v1'>2403.10748v1</a></div>

required to enable low-cost computations in design and control. This work
presents a physics-preserving reduced model learning approach that targets PDEs
whose quadratic operators preserve energy, such as those arising in governing

generally learn a reduced quadratic operator with the energy-preserving
property of the original PDE. Thus, we propose a new energy-preserving Operator
Inference (EP-OpInf) approach, which imposes this structure on the learned
reduced model via constrained optimization. Numerical results using the viscous

quantifying both aleatoric (i.e., irreducible) and epistemic (i.e., reducible)
sources of uncertainties in the modeling of engineered systems. The
data-consistent (DC) framework poses an inverse problem and solution for
quantifying aleatoric uncertainties in terms of pullback and push-forward
measures for a given Quantity of Interest (QoI) map. Unfortunately, a
pre-specified QoI map is not always available a priori to the collection of
data associated with system outputs. The data themselves are often polluted
with measurement errors (i.e., epistemic uncertainties), which complicates the
process of specifying a useful QoI. The Learning Uncertain Quantities (LUQ)
framework defines a formal three-step machine-learning enabled process for
transforming noisy datasets into samples of a learned QoI map to enable
DC-based inversion. We develop a robust filtering step in LUQ that can learn
the most useful quantitative information present in spatio-temporal datasets.
The learned QoI map transforms simulated and observed datasets into
distributions to perform DC-based inversion. We also develop a DC-based
inversion scheme that iterates over time as new spatial datasets are obtained
and utilizes quantitative diagnostics to identify both the quality and impact
of inversion at each iteration. Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space theory is
leveraged to mathematically analyze the learned QoI map and develop a
quantitative sufficiency test for evaluating the filtered data. An illustrative
example is utilized throughout while the final two examples involve the
