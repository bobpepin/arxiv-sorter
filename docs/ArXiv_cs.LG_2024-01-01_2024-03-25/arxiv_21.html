logical knowledge into deep learning via encoding logical constraints as an
additional loss function. However, existing approaches tend to vacuously
satisfy logical constraints through shortcuts, failing to fully exploit the
knowledge. In this paper, we present a new framework for learning with logical
constraints. Specifically, we address the shortcut satisfaction issue by
introducing dual variables for logical connectives, encoding how the constraint
is satisfied. We further propose a variational framework where the encoded
logical constraint is expressed as a distributional loss that is compatible
with the model's original training loss. The theoretical analysis shows that
the proposed approach bears salient properties, and the experimental

implement benchmarks for continual and semi-supervised learning, with a
specific focus on symbol compositionality. Classification rules are also
provided in the ground truth to enable analysis of interpretable solutions.
Together with the benchmark generation pipeline, we release two curricula, an
easier and a harder one, that we propose as new challenges for the research

prizes, the best algorithms still fail to solve a majority of ARC tasks and
rely on complex hand-crafted rules, without using machine learning at all. We
revisit whether recent advances in neural networks allow progress on this task.
  First, we adapt the DreamCoder neurosymbolic reasoning solver to ARC.
DreamCoder automatically writes programs in a bespoke domain-specific language
to perform reasoning, using a neural network to mimic human intuition. We
present the Perceptual Abstraction and Reasoning Language (PeARL) language,
which allows DreamCoder to solve ARC tasks, and propose a new recognition model
that allows us to significantly improve on the previous best implementation.We
also propose a new encoding and augmentation scheme that allows large language

some ARC tasks. LLMs are able to solve a different group of problems to
state-of-the-art solvers, and provide an interesting way to complement other

nature of algorithmic reasoning tasks. Based on this motivation, we present our
ForgetNet, which does not use historical embeddings and thus is consistent with

enhanced capability provides valuable computational pathways during the model's

  In this paper, we overcome the limitations of existing CFA schemes for

control- and non-control-data attacks. It efficiently extracts features from

identify deviations from benign executions. The core intuition behind RAGE is
to exploit the correspondence between execution trace, execution graph, and
execution embeddings to eliminate the unrealistic requirement of having access
to a complete CFG.
  We evaluate RAGE on embedded benchmarks and demonstrate that (i) it detects
40 real-world attacks on embedded software; (ii) Further, we stress our scheme

large language models (LLMs) on arithmetics and symbolic reasoning tasks.
However, the mechanism behind CoT remains unclear. This work provides a
theoretical understanding of the power of CoT for decoder-only transformers
through the lens of expressiveness. Conceptually, CoT empowers the model with
the ability to perform inherently serial computation, which is otherwise
lacking in transformers, especially when depth is low. Given input length $n$,
previous works have shown that constant-depth transformers with finite
precision $\mathsf{poly}(n)$ embedding size can only solve problems in
$\mathsf{TC}^0$ without CoT. We first show an even tighter expressiveness upper
bound for constant-depth transformers with constant-bit precision, which can
only solve problems in $\mathsf{AC}^0$, a proper subset of $ \mathsf{TC}^0$.
However, with $T$ steps of CoT, constant-depth transformers using constant-bit
precision and $O(\log n)$ embedding size can solve any problem solvable by
boolean circuits of size $T$. Empirically, enabling CoT dramatically improves
the accuracy for tasks that are hard for parallel computation, including the
composition of permutation groups, iterated squaring, and circuit value
problems, especially for low-depth transformers.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12875v1'>2402.12875v1</a></div>

reasoning by utilizing the abilities of both explicit, compositional symbolic
and implicit neural representations. This is achieved by retrieving object
representations from images and synthesizing relational concepts as
lambda-calculus programs. We evaluate the diverse properties of Pix2Code on the
challenging reasoning domains, Kandinsky Patterns and CURI, thereby testing its
ability to identify compositional visual concepts that generalize to novel data
and concept configurations. Particularly, in stark contrast to neural

identification of relational patterns that are abstracted away from object
features, and the systematic generalization of those patterns to unseen

visual reasoning tasks involving multi-object inputs, through the integration
of slot-based methods used for extracting object-centric representations
coupled with strong inductive biases for relational abstraction. However, this
approach was limited to problems containing a single rule, and was not scalable
to visual reasoning problems containing a large number of objects. Other recent
work proposed Abstractors, an extension of Transformers that incorporates
strong relational inductive biases, thereby inheriting the Transformer's
scalability and multi-head architecture, but it has yet to be demonstrated how
this approach might be applied to multi-object visual inputs. Here we combine
the strengths of the above approaches and propose Slot Abstractors, an approach
to abstract visual reasoning that can be scaled to problems involving a large

auto-regressive LLMs cannot, by themselves, do planning or self-verification
(which is after all a form of reasoning), and shed some light on the reasons
for misunderstandings in the literature. We will also argue that LLMs should be
viewed as universal approximate knowledge sources that have much more
meaningful roles to play in planning/reasoning tasks beyond simple
front-end/back-end format translators. We present a vision of {\bf LLM-Modulo
Frameworks} that combine the strengths of LLMs with external model-based
verifiers in a tighter bi-directional interaction regime. We will show how the
models driving the external verifiers themselves can be acquired with the help
of LLMs. We will also argue that rather than simply pipelining LLMs and
symbolic components, this LLM-Modulo Framework provides a better neuro-symbolic
approach that offers tighter integration between LLMs and symbolic components,
and allows extending the scope of model-based planning/reasoning regimes
towards more flexible knowledge, problem and preference specifications.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01817v2'>2402.01817v2</a></div>

that reflects the state reachability and allows multi-way probabilistic
inference. Moreover, by conditioning on a common reference state (e.g. the
observer's current state), the learned representation space allows us to
discover the geometrically salient states that only a handful of paths can lead
through. These states can naturally serve as subgoals to break down
long-horizon planning tasks. We evaluate our method in gridworld environments

3-D environments compared to 2-D environments, where pixel changes between

these tasks leads us to wonder: What is the ability of LLMs to solve vehicle
routing problems (VRPs) with natural language task descriptions? In this work,
we study this question in three steps. First, we construct a dataset with 21
types of single- or multi-vehicle routing problems. Second, we evaluate the
performance of LLMs across four basic prompt paradigms of text-to-code
generation, each involving different types of text input. We find that the
basic prompt paradigm, which generates code directly from natural language task
descriptions, performs the best for GPT-4, achieving 56% feasibility, 40%
optimality, and 53% efficiency. Third, based on the observation that LLMs may
not be able to provide correct solutions at the initial attempt, we propose a
framework that enables LLMs to refine solutions through self-reflection,
including self-debugging and self-verification. With GPT-4, our proposed
framework achieves a 16% increase in feasibility, a 7% increase in optimality,
and a 15% increase in efficiency. Moreover, we examine the sensitivity of GPT-4
to task descriptions, specifically focusing on how its performance changes when
certain details are omitted from the task descriptions, yet the core meaning is
preserved. Our findings reveal that such omissions lead to a notable decrease
in performance: 4% in feasibility, 4% in optimality, and 5% in efficiency.

spatial knowledge} is crucial for geographic information retrieval (GIR) and in
spatial cognitive research. However, NLP navigation studies often overlook the
impact of such acquired knowledge on textual descriptions. Current navigation
studies concentrate on egocentric local descriptions (e.g., `it will be on your
right') that require reasoning over the agent's local perception. These
instructions are typically given as a sequence of steps, with each action-step
explicitly mentioning and being followed by a landmark that the agent can use
to verify they are on the right path (e.g., `turn right and then you will
see...'). In contrast, descriptions based on knowledge acquired through a map
provide a complete view of the environment and capture its overall structure.
These instructions (e.g., `it is south of Central Park and a block north of a
police station') are typically non-sequential, contain allocentric relations,
with multiple spatial relations and implicit actions, without any explicit
verification. This paper introduces the Rendezvous (RVS) task and dataset,
which includes 10,404 examples of English geospatial instructions for reaching
a target location using map-knowledge. Our analysis reveals that RVS exhibits a
richer use of spatial allocentric relations, and requires resolving more

their complexity makes it often challenging to interpret the rationale behind
their decisions. Counterfactual explanations (CEs) have emerged as a viable
solution for generating comprehensible explanations in eXplainable Artificial
Intelligence (XAI). CE provides actionable information to users on how to
achieve the desired outcome with minimal modifications to the input. However,
current CE algorithms usually operate within the entire feature space when
optimizing changes to turn over an undesired outcome, overlooking the
identification of key contributors to the outcome and disregarding the
practicality of the suggested changes. In this study, we introduce a novel
methodology, that is named as user feedback-based counterfactual explanation
(UFCE), which addresses these limitations and aims to bolster confidence in the
provided explanations. UFCE allows for the inclusion of user constraints to
determine the smallest modifications in the subset of actionable features while
considering feature dependence, and evaluates the practicality of suggested
changes using benchmark evaluation metrics. We conducted three experiments with
five datasets, demonstrating that UFCE outperforms two well-known CE methods in
terms of \textit{proximity}, \textit{sparsity}, and \textit{feasibility}.
Reported results indicate that user constraints influence the generation of
feasible CEs.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00011v1'>2403.00011v1</a></div>

Additionally, it conducts a comparative experiment between two families of

methods has acquired significant importance, and the analysis of the associated
uncertainties has motivated a growing amount of research. However, most of
these studies have applied standard error analysis to ML models, and in
particular Deep Neural Network (DNN) models, which represent a rather
significant departure from standard scientific modelling. It is therefore
necessary to integrate the standard error analysis with a deeper
epistemological analysis of the possible differences between DNN models and
standard scientific modelling and the possible implications of these
differences in the assessment of reliability. This article offers several
contributions. First, it emphasises the ubiquitous role of model assumptions
(both in ML and traditional Science) against the illusion of theory-free
science. Secondly, model assumptions are analysed from the point of view of
their (epistemic) complexity, which is shown to be language-independent. It is
argued that the high epistemic complexity of DNN models hinders the estimate of
their reliability and also their prospect of long-term progress. Some potential
ways forward are suggested. Thirdly, this article identifies the close relation
between a model's epistemic complexity and its interpretability, as introduced
in the context of responsible AI. This clarifies in which sense, and to what
extent, the lack of understanding of a model (black-box problem) impacts its
interpretability in a way that is independent of individual skills. It also
clarifies how interpretability is a precondition for assessing the reliability
of any model, which cannot be based on statistical analysis alone. This article
focuses on the comparison between traditional scientific models and DNN models.

overconfident models, communicating when the output should (not) be trusted.
Although methods for uncertainty estimation have been developed, they have not

This work proposes a general uncertainty framework, with contributions being
threefold: (i) uncertainty estimation in ML models is positioned as an XAI

challenging the conventional belief that classification robustness and

explanation robustness does not necessarily flatten the input loss landscape
with respect to explanation loss - contrary to flattened loss landscapes
indicating better classification robustness. To deeply investigate this
contradiction, a groundbreaking training method designed to adjust the loss
landscape with respect to explanation loss is proposed. Through the new
training method, we uncover that although such adjustments can impact the
robustness of explanations, they do not have an influence on the robustness of

semantic conditioning at inference, which only constrains the system during
inference while leaving the training unaffected. We discuss its theoritical and
practical advantages over two other popular neurosymbolic techniques: semantic
conditioning and semantic regularization. We develop a new multi-scale
methodology to evaluate how the benefits of a neurosymbolic technique evolve
with the scale of the network. We then evaluate experimentally and compare the

In CBM, concepts which correspond to reasons of outputs are inserted in the

interpret the relationship between the output and concept similar to linear
regression. However, this interpretation requires observing all concepts and
decreases the generalization performance of neural networks. Partial CBM
(PCBM), which uses partially observed concepts, has been devised to resolve
these difficulties. Although some numerical experiments suggest that the
generalization performance of PCBMs is almost as high as that of the original
neural networks, the theoretical behavior of its generalization error has not
been yet clarified since PCBM is singular statistical model. In this paper, we
reveal the Bayesian generalization error in PCBM with a three-layered and

it avoids producing incorrect or "hallucinated" answers or taking unsafe

predictions do not distinguish between per-response noise (aleatoric
uncertainty) and lack of knowledge about the process (epistemic uncertainty),
and existing epistemic uncertainty quantification techniques tend to be
overconfident when the model underfits. We propose a general strategy for
teaching a model to both approximate $p(Y|X)$ and also estimate the remaining
gaps between ${\widehat{p}}_{\theta}(Y|X)$ and $p(Y|X)$: train it to predict
pairs of independent responses drawn from the true conditional distribution,
allow it to "cheat" by observing one response while predicting the other, then
measure how much it cheats. Remarkably, we prove that being good at cheating
(i.e. cheating whenever it improves your prediction) is equivalent to being
second-order calibrated, a principled extension of ordinary calibration that
allows us to construct provably-correct frequentist confidence intervals for
$p(Y|X)$ and detect incorrect responses with high probability. We demonstrate

considering pointwise estimates for the prototypes, which remain fixed after
the learning phase of the model. In this paper, we introduce a probabilistic

the prototypes with probability distributions over their values. This provides
not only a more flexible framework for an end-to-end learning of prototypes,

determine both the explanation and the prediction, Prob-PSENNs allow us to
detect when the model is making uninformed or uncertain predictions, and to
obtain valid explanations for them. Our experiments demonstrate that

the need to build DNNs with built-in interpretability. Motivated by this, many
self-explaining neural networks have been proposed to generate not only
accurate predictions but also clear and intuitive insights into why a

external participants. The central mechanism enabling this marketplace is the
agents' dual capabilities: they not only have the capacity to assess the

visualization without altering the model architecture or significantly
impacting the model's decision-making process. We evaluate the effectiveness of
our method on several neural network models and demonstrate its capabilities to
hide the functionality of specific neurons by masking the original explanations
of neurons with chosen target explanations during model auditing. As a remedy,
we propose a protective measure against such manipulations and provide

response tokens one by one and streams each generated token (or group of a few
tokens) through the network to the user right after it is generated, which we
refer to as LLM token streaming. However, under unstable network conditions,
the LLM token streaming experience could suffer greatly from stalls since one
packet loss could block the rendering of tokens contained in subsequent packets
even if they arrive on time. With a real-world measurement study, we show that
current applications including ChatGPT, Claude, and Bard all suffer from
increased stall under unstable network.
  For this emerging token streaming problem in LLM Chatbots, we propose a novel
transport layer scheme, called Chatterbox, which puts new generated tokens as
well as currently unacknowledged tokens in the next outgoing packet. This
ensures that each packet contains some new tokens and can be independently
rendered when received, thus avoiding aforementioned stalls caused by missing
packets. Through simulation under various network conditions, we show
Chatterbox reduces stall ratio (proportion of token rendering wait time) by
71.0% compared to the token streaming method commonly used by real chatbot
applications and by 31.6% compared to a custom packet duplication scheme. By
tailoring Chatterbox to fit the token-by-token generation of LLM, we enable the

Locate-and-Edit (L\&amp;E) methods accomplish this by finding where relevant
information is stored within the neural network, and editing the weights at
that location. The goal of editing is to modify the response of an LLM to a
proposition independently of its phrasing, while not modifying its response to
other related propositions. Existing methods are limited to binary
propositions, which represent straightforward binary relations between a
subject and an object. Furthermore, existing methods rely on semantic subject
labels, which may not be available or even be well-defined in practice. In this
paper, we show that both of these issues can be effectively skirted with a
simple and fast localization method called Gradient Tracing (GT). This
localization method allows editing arbitrary propositions instead of just
binary ones, and does so without the need for subject labels. As propositions
always have a truth value, our experiments prompt an LLM as a boolean
classifier, and edit its T/F response to propositions. Our method applies GT
for location tracing, and then edit the model at that location using a mild
variant of Rank-One Model Editing (ROME). On datasets of binary propositions
derived from the CounterFact dataset, we show that our method -- without access
to subject labels -- performs close to state-of-the-art L\&amp;E methods which has
access subject labels. We then introduce a new dataset, Factual Accuracy

traditional recommendation tasks into challenges of natural language
generation, there has been a relative scarcity of exploration in the domain of
session-based recommendation (SBR) due to its specificity. SBR has been
primarily dominated by Graph Neural Networks, which have achieved many
successful outcomes due to their ability to capture both the implicit and
explicit relationships between adjacent behaviors. The structural nature of
graphs contrasts with the essence of natural language, posing a significant
adaptation gap for LLMs. In this paper, we introduce large language models with
graphical Session-Based recommendation, named LLMGR, an effective framework
that bridges the aforementioned gap by harmoniously integrating LLMs with Graph

complementary strengths of LLMs in natural language understanding and GNNs in
relational data processing, leading to a more powerful session-based
recommender system that can understand and recommend items within a session.
Moreover, to endow the LLM with the capability to empower SBR tasks, we design
a series of prompts for both auxiliary and major instruction tuning tasks.
These prompts are crafted to assist the LLM in understanding graph-structured

solve a diverse set of tasks in fields including social science, chemistry, and

improving empirical performance on tasks like node or graph classification.
However, a line of recent work has instead sought to find GNN architectures
that have desirable theoretical properties - by studying their expressive power
and designing architectures that maximize this expressiveness.
  While there is no consensus on the best way to define the expressiveness of a
GNN, it can be viewed from several well-motivated perspectives. Perhaps the
most natural approach is to study the universal approximation properties of
GNNs, much in the way that this has been studied extensively for MLPs. Another
direction focuses on the extent to which GNNs can distinguish between different
graph structures, relating this to the graph isomorphism test. Besides, a GNN's
ability to compute graph properties such as graph moments has been suggested as
another form of expressiveness. All of these different definitions are
complementary and have yielded different recommendations for GNN architecture
choices. In this paper, we would like to give an overview of the notion of
"expressive power" of GNNs and provide some valuable insights regarding the

assessed via the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) hierarchy. However, such an

qualitative, and may not well reflect practical requirements (e.g., the ability
to encode substructures). In this paper, we introduce a unified framework for
quantitatively studying the expressiveness of GNN architectures, addressing all
the above limitations. Specifically, we identify a fundamental expressivity
measure termed homomorphism expressivity, which quantifies the ability of GNN
models to count graphs under homomorphism. Homomorphism expressivity offers a
complete and practical assessment tool: the completeness enables direct
expressivity comparisons between GNN models, while the practicality allows for
understanding concrete GNN abilities such as subgraph counting. By examining
four classes of prominent GNNs as case studies, we derive simple, unified, and
elegant descriptions of their homomorphism expressivity for both invariant and
equivariant settings. Our results provide novel insights into a series of

We direct our focus to the complex algebraic learning task of modular addition
involving $k$ inputs. Our research presents a thorough analytical
characterization of the features learned by stylized one-hidden layer neural
networks and one-layer Transformers in addressing this task.
  A cornerstone of our theoretical framework is the elucidation of how the

unifies most propagation-based graph neural networks. By generating
directed-weighted propagation graphs with adjacency function and connectivity

Theoretically, we demonstrate that CURC possesses continuity, scale invariance,
and a lower bound connection with the Dirichlet isoperimetric constant
validating bottleneck analysis for GPNNs. We include a preliminary exploration
of learned propagation patterns in datasets, a first in the field. We observe
an intriguing ``{\em \textbf{decurve flow}}'' - a curvature reduction during

However, there remain many open questions regarding the physical mechanisms of

the characteristic temperatures necessary to compute glass stability (GS) and
assess the feasibility of using these physics-informed ML (PIML)-predicted GS
parameters to estimate GFA. In doing so, we track the uncertainties at each
step of the computation - from the original ML prediction errors, to the
compounding of errors during GS estimation, and finally to the final estimation
of GFA. While GlassNet exhibits reasonable accuracy on all individual
properties, we observe a large compounding of error in the combination of these
individual predictions for the prediction of GS, finding that random forest
models offer similar accuracy to GlassNet. We also breakdown the ML performance
on different glass families and find that the error in GS prediction is
correlated with the error in crystallization peak temperature prediction.
Lastly, we utilize this finding to assess the relationship between

some biochemical properties, playing a pivotal role in the drug discovery and
design process. Recently, with the advancement of machine learning, deep
learning-based molecular property prediction has emerged as a solution to the
resource-intensive nature of traditional methods, garnering significant
attention. Among them, molecular representation learning is the key factor for
molecular property prediction performance. And there are lots of
sequence-based, graph-based, and geometry-based methods that have been
proposed. However, the majority of existing studies focus solely on one
modality for learning molecular representations, failing to comprehensively
capture molecular characteristics and information. In this paper, a novel
multi-modal representation learning model, which integrates the sequence,
graph, and geometry characteristics, is proposed for molecular property
prediction, called SGGRL. Specifically, we design a fusion layer to fusion the
representation of different modalities. Furthermore, to ensure consistency
across modalities, SGGRL is trained to maximize the similarity of
representations for the same molecule while minimizing similarity for different
molecules. To verify the effectiveness of SGGRL, seven molecular datasets, and
several baselines are used for evaluation and comparison. The experimental
results demonstrate that SGGRL consistently outperforms the baselines in most
cases. This further underscores the capability of SGGRL to comprehensively
capture molecular information. Overall, the proposed SGGRL model showcases its
potential to revolutionize molecular property prediction by leveraging
multi-modal representation learning to extract diverse and comprehensive
molecular insights. Our code is released at

proficient representation learning. It is crucial to incorporate diverse
molecular relationships characterized by multi-similarity (self-similarity and
relative similarities) between molecules. However, current molecular
representation learning methods fall short in exploring multi-similarity and
often underestimate the complexity of relationships between molecules.
Additionally, previous multi-similarity approaches require the specification of
positive and negative pairs to attribute distinct predefined weights to
different relative similarities, which can introduce potential bias. In this
work, we introduce Graph Multi-Similarity Learning for Molecular Property
Prediction (GraphMSL) framework, along with a novel approach to formulate a
generalized multi-similarity metric without the need to define positive and
negative pairs. In each of the chemical modality spaces (e.g.,molecular
depiction image, fingerprint, NMR, and SMILES) under consideration, we first
define a self-similarity metric (i.e., similarity between an anchor molecule
and another molecule), and then transform it into a generalized
multi-similarity metric for the anchor through a pair weighting function.
GraphMSL validates the efficacy of the multi-similarity metric across
MoleculeNet datasets. Furthermore, these metrics of all modalities are
integrated into a multimodal multi-similarity metric, which showcases the
potential to improve the performance. Moreover, the focus of the model can be
redirected or customized by altering the fusion function. Last but not least,
GraphMSL proves effective in drug discovery evaluations through post-hoc
analyses of the learnt representations.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17615v2'>2401.17615v2</a></div>

real-world scenarios due to various factors, e.g., modality missing and domain

processes and play a key role in life activities. The growing demand and cost
of experimental PPI assays require computational methods for efficient PPI
prediction. While existing methods rely heavily on protein sequence for PPI
prediction, it is the protein structure that is the key to determine the
interactions. To take both protein modalities into account, we define the
microenvironment of an amino acid residue by its sequence and structural
contexts, which describe the surrounding chemical properties and geometric
features. In addition, microenvironments defined in previous work are largely
based on experimentally assayed physicochemical properties, for which the
"vocabulary" is usually extremely small. This makes it difficult to cover the
diversity and complexity of microenvironments. In this paper, we propose
Microenvironment-Aware Protein Embedding for PPI prediction (MPAE-PPI), which
encodes microenvironments into chemically meaningful discrete codes via a
sufficiently large microenvironment "vocabulary" (i.e., codebook). Moreover, we
propose a novel pre-training strategy, namely Masked Codebook Modeling (MCM),
to capture the dependencies between different microenvironments by randomly
masking the codebook and reconstructing the input. With the learned
microenvironment codebook, we can reuse it as an off-the-shelf tool to

advantages of ACPs is their ability to selectively target cancer cells while
sparing healthy cells to a greater extent. This selectivity is often attributed
to differences in the surface properties of cancer cells compared to normal
cells. That is why ACPs are being investigated as potential candidates for
cancer therapy. ACPs may be used alone or in combination with other treatment

as we apply it on larger graphs drawn from some random graph model. We show
that the output converges to a constant function, which upper-bounds what these
classifiers can express uniformly. This convergence phenomenon applies to a
very wide class of GNNs, including state of the art models, with aggregates
including mean and the attention-based mechanism of graph transformers. Our
results apply to a broad class of random graph models, including the (sparse)
Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi model and the stochastic block model. We empirically validate
these findings, observing that the convergence phenomenon already manifests
itself on graphs of relatively modest size.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03880v1'>2403.03880v1</a></div>

Essentially, a GNN is a distributed message passing algorithm, which is
controlled by parameters learned from data. It operates on the vertices of a
graph: in each iteration, vertices receive a message on each incoming edge,
aggregate these messages, and then update their state based on their current
state and the aggregated messages. The expressivity of GNNs can be
characterised in terms of certain fragments of first-order logic with counting
and the Weisfeiler-Lehman algorithm.
  The core GNN architecture comes in two different versions. In the first
version, a message only depends on the state of the source vertex, whereas in
the second version it depends on the states of the source and target vertices.
In practice, both of these versions are used, but the theory of GNNs so far
mostly focused on the first one. On the logical side, the two versions
correspond to two fragments of first-order logic with counting that we call
modal and guarded.
  The question whether the two versions differ in their expressivity has been
mostly overlooked in the GNN literature and has only been asked recently
(Grohe, LICS'23). We answer this question here. It turns out that the answer is
not as straightforward as one might expect. By proving that the modal and
guarded fragment of first-order logic with counting have the same expressivity
over labelled undirected graphs, we show that in a non-uniform setting the two
GNN versions have the same expressivity. However, we also prove that in a
uniform setting the second version is strictly more expressive.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06817v1'>2403.06817v1</a></div>

Existing attacks on GNNs are all single-step and do not account for the dynamic
cascading nature of information diffusion in networks. We consider the
realistic scenario where an adversary uses a GNN as a proxy to predict and
manipulate voter preferences, especially uncertain voters. Gradient-based
attacks on the GNN inform the adversary of strategic manipulations that can be

Canvassing (MAC) to address it. MAC makes dynamic local decisions based on the
heuristic of low budget and high second-order influence to convert and perturb
target voters. MAC is a dynamic multi-step attack that discovers low-budget and

financial networks, various approaches have been developed. While they
typically assume static input graphs, most real-world graphs grow over time,
naturally represented as edge streams. In this context, we aim to achieve three
goals: (a) instantly detecting anomalies as they occur, (b) adapting to
dynamically changing states, and (c) handling the scarcity of dynamic anomaly
labels. In this paper, we propose SLADE (Self-supervised Learning for Anomaly
Detection in Edge Streams) for rapid detection of dynamic anomalies in edge
streams, without relying on labels. SLADE detects the shifts of nodes into
abnormal states by observing deviations in their interaction patterns over
time. To this end, it trains a deep neural network to perform two
self-supervised tasks: (a) minimizing drift in node representations and (b)
generating long-term interaction patterns from short-term ones. Failure in
these tasks for a node signals its deviation from the norm. Notably, the neural
network and tasks are carefully designed so that all required operations can be
performed in constant time (w.r.t. the graph size) in response to each new edge
in the input stream. In dynamic anomaly detection across four real-world

fraud in business processes. Traditional process mining approaches focus on
analyzing 'flattened', sequential, event logs based on a single case notion.
However, many real-world process executions exhibit a graph-like structure,
where events can be associated with multiple cases. Flattening event logs
requires selecting a single case identifier which creates a gap with the real
event data and artificially introduces anomalies in the event logs.
Object-centric process mining avoids these limitations by allowing events to be
related to different cases. This study proposes a novel framework for anomaly
detection in business processes that exploits graph neural networks and the
enhanced information offered by object-centric process mining. We first
reconstruct and represent the process dependencies of the object-centric event

scenario, where part of the nodes in a graph are known to be normal,
contrasting to the unsupervised setting in most GAD studies with a fully
unlabeled graph. As expected, we find that having access to these normal nodes
helps enhance the detection performance of existing unsupervised GAD methods
when they are adapted to the semi-supervised setting. However, their
utilization of these normal nodes is limited. In this paper, we propose a novel
Generative GAD approach (GGAD) for the semi-supervised scenario to better
exploit the normal nodes. The key idea is to generate outlier nodes that
assimilate anomaly nodes in both local structure and node representations for
providing effective negative node samples in training a discriminative
one-class classifier. There have been many generative anomaly detection
approaches, but they are designed for non-graph data, and as a result, they
fail to take account of the graph structure information. Our approach tackles
this problem by generating graph structure-aware outlier nodes that have
asymmetric affinity separability from normal nodes while being enforced to
achieve egocentric closeness to normal nodes in the node representation space.
Comprehensive experiments on four real-world datasets are performed to
establish a benchmark for semi-supervised GAD and show that GGAD substantially
outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised and semi-supervised GAD methods with

post-hoc calibration strategies can be used to improve in-distribution

However, techniques which produce GNNs with better intrinsic uncertainty

post-hoc strategies later. Therefore, in this work, we propose G-$\Delta$UQ, a
novel training framework designed to improve intrinsic GNN uncertainty

partially stochastic GNNs. While, the prevalent wisdom is that fully stochastic

functional diversity induced by our anchoring strategies when sampling
hypotheses renders this unnecessary and allows us to support G-$\Delta$UQ on
pretrained models. Indeed, through extensive evaluation under covariate,

learning on graphs, as graph neural networks (GNNs) often exhibit performance
degradation with distribution shifts. The challenge is that distribution shifts
on graphs involve intricate interconnections between nodes, and the environment
labels are often absent in data. In this paper, we adopt a bottom-up
data-generative perspective and reveal a key observation through causal
analysis: the crux of GNNs' failure in OOD generalization lies in the latent
confounding bias from the environment. The latter misguides the model to
leverage environment-sensitive correlations between ego-graph features and
target nodes' labels, resulting in undesirable generalization on new unseen
nodes. Built upon this analysis, we introduce a conceptually simple yet
principled approach for training robust GNNs under node-level distribution
shifts, without prior knowledge of environment labels. Our method resorts to a
new learning objective derived from causal inference that coordinates an
environment estimator and a mixture-of-expert GNN predictor. The new approach
can counteract the confounding bias in training data and facilitate learning
generalizable predictive relations. Extensive experiment demonstrates that our

with out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Several approaches have been proposed to
address this problem. Among them, one solution is to diversify training
distributions in vanilla classification by modifying the data environment, yet
accessing the environment information is complex. Besides, another promising
approach involves rationalization, extracting invariant rationales for
predictions. However, extracting rationales is difficult due to limited
learning signals, resulting in less accurate rationales and diminished
predictions. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a
Cooperative Classification and Rationalization (C2R) method, consisting of the
classification and the rationalization module. Specifically, we first assume
that multiple environments are available in the classification module. Then, we
introduce diverse training distributions using an environment-conditional
generative network, enabling robust graph representations. Meanwhile, the
rationalization module employs a separator to identify relevant rationale
subgraphs while the remaining non-rationale subgraphs are de-correlated with
labels. Next, we align graph representations from the classification module
with rationale subgraph representations using the knowledge distillation
methods, enhancing the learning signal for rationales. Finally, we infer
multiple environments by gathering non-rationale representations and
incorporate them into the classification module for cooperative learning.

graph structures in these problems. To address these issues, we develop and
introduce a collection of synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real-world datasets
that fulfill a broad spectrum of requirements. These datasets are thoughtfully
designed to include relevant graph structures and bias information crucial for
the fair evaluation of models. The proposed synthetic and semi-synthetic
datasets offer the flexibility to create data with controllable bias
parameters, thereby enabling the generation of desired datasets with
user-defined bias values with ease. Moreover, we conduct systematic evaluations
of these proposed datasets and establish a unified evaluation approach for fair
graph learning models. Our extensive experimental results with fair graph
learning methods across our datasets demonstrate their effectiveness in
benchmarking the performance of these methods. Our datasets and the code for

structural properties and apply them to different downstream tasks. Similar to
pre-trained language models, PGMs also inherit biases from human society,
resulting in discriminatory behavior in downstream applications. The debiasing
process of existing fair methods is generally coupled with parameter
optimization of GNNs. However, different downstream tasks may be associated
with different sensitive attributes in reality, directly employing existing
methods to improve the fairness of PGMs is inflexible and inefficient.
Moreover, most of them lack a theoretical guarantee, i.e., provable lower
bounds on the fairness of model predictions, which directly provides assurance
in a practical scenario. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel
adapter-tuning framework that endows pre-trained graph models with provable
fairness (called GraphPAR). GraphPAR freezes the parameters of PGMs and trains
a parameter-efficient adapter to flexibly improve the fairness of PGMs in
downstream tasks. Specifically, we design a sensitive semantic augmenter on
node representations, to extend the node representations with different
sensitive attribute semantics for each node. The extended representations will
be used to further train an adapter, to prevent the propagation of sensitive
attribute semantics from PGMs to task predictions. Furthermore, with GraphPAR,
we quantify whether the fairness of each node is provable, i.e., predictions
are always fair within a certain range of sensitive attribute semantics.
Experimental evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that GraphPAR
achieves state-of-the-art prediction performance and fairness on node
classification task. Furthermore, based on our GraphPAR, around 90\% nodes have
provable fairness.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12161v2'>2402.12161v2</a></div>

such filtering-based strategies may also filter out some non-sensitive feature

neutralization-based paradigm, where additional Fairness-facilitating Features

provide theoretical explanations for our rationale, concluding that F3 can be
realized by emphasizing the features of each node's heterogeneous neighbors

under distribution shifts? How does distribution shifts affect graph fairness

introduce for the first time a method for incorporating the Gini coefficient as
a measure of fairness to be used within the GNN framework. Our proposal,
GRAPHGINI, works with the two different goals of individual and group fairness
in a single system, while maintaining high prediction accuracy. GRAPHGINI
enforces individual fairness through learnable attention scores that help in
aggregating more information through similar nodes. A heuristic-based maximum
Nash social welfare constraint ensures the maximum possible group fairness.
Both the individual fairness constraint and the group fairness constraint are
stated in terms of a differentiable approximation of the Gini coefficient. This

GRAPHGINI automatically balances all three optimization objectives (utility,

While Graph
Neural Network (GNN)-based fraud detection methods perform well, they often
overlook the causal effect of a node's local structure on predictions. This
paper introduces a novel method for credit card fraud detection, the
\textbf{\underline{Ca}}usal \textbf{\underline{T}}emporal
\textbf{\underline{G}}raph \textbf{\underline{N}}eural \textbf{N}etwork
(CaT-GNN), which leverages causal invariant learning to reveal inherent
correlations within transaction data. By decomposing the problem into discovery
and intervention phases, CaT-GNN identifies causal nodes within the transaction
graph and applies a causal mixup strategy to enhance the model's robustness and
interpretability. CaT-GNN consists of two key components: Causal-Inspector and
Causal-Intervener. The Causal-Inspector utilizes attention weights in the
temporal attention mechanism to identify causal and environment nodes without
introducing additional parameters. Subsequently, the Causal-Intervener performs
a causal mixup enhancement on environment nodes based on the set of nodes.
Evaluated on three datasets, including a private financial dataset and two
public datasets, CaT-GNN demonstrates superior performance over existing
state-of-the-art methods. Our findings highlight the potential of integrating
causal reasoning with graph neural networks to improve fraud detection
capabilities in financial transactions.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14708v1'>2402.14708v1</a></div>

different types of connections arise from the geographical location of the
borrower and their choice of mortgage provider. The proposed model considers
both types of connections and the evolution of these connections over time. We
enhance the model by using a custom attention mechanism that weights the
different time snapshots according to their importance. After testing multiple

a surge of interest in recent years. Most embedding methods assume that all
test entities are available during training, which makes it time-consuming to
retrain embeddings for newly emerging entities. To address this issue, recent
works apply the graph neural network on the existing neighbors of the unseen
entities. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, namely Virtual Neighbor
(VN) network, to address three key challenges. Firstly, to reduce the neighbor
sparsity problem, we introduce the concept of the virtual neighbors inferred by
rules. And we assign soft labels to these neighbors by solving a
rule-constrained problem, rather than simply regarding them as unquestionably
true. Secondly, many existing methods only use one-hop or two-hop neighbors for
aggregation and ignore the distant information that may be helpful. Instead, we
identify both logic and symmetric path rules to capture complex patterns.
Finally, instead of one-time injection of rules, we employ an iterative
learning scheme between the embedding method and virtual neighbor prediction to
capture the interactions within. Experimental results on two knowledge graph
completion tasks demonstrate that our VN network significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, results on Subject/Object-R show that

concerns, because many real-world graph data contain sensitive information like
person's friend list. Differential privacy (DP) is a common method to protect
privacy, but due to the complex topological structure of graph data, applying
DP on graphs often affects the message passing and aggregation of GNN models,
leading to a decrease in model accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel
graph edge protection framework, graph publisher (GraphPub), which can protect
graph topology while ensuring that the availability of data is basically
unchanged. Through reverse learning and the encoder-decoder mechanism, we
search for some false edges that do not have a large negative impact on the
aggregation of node features, and use them to replace some real edges. The

graph-structured data and are demonstrated to be useful in many applications.
However, the GNN training pipeline has been shown to be vulnerable to node
feature leakage and edge extraction attacks. This paper investigates a scenario
where an attacker aims to recover private edge information from a trained GNN
model. Previous studies have employed differential privacy (DP) to add noise
directly to the adjacency matrix or a compact graph representation. The added
perturbations cause the graph structure to be substantially morphed, reducing
the model utility. We propose a new privacy-preserving GNN training algorithm,
Eclipse, that maintains good model utility while providing strong privacy
protection on edges. Eclipse is based on two key observations. First, adjacency
matrices in graph structures exhibit low-rank behavior. Thus, Eclipse trains
GNNs with a low-rank format of the graph via singular values decomposition
(SVD), rather than the original graph. Using the low-rank format, Eclipse
preserves the primary graph topology and removes the remaining residual edges.
Eclipse adds noise to the low-rank singular values instead of the entire graph,
thereby preserving the graph privacy while still maintaining enough of the
graph structure to maintain model utility. We theoretically show Eclipse
provide formal DP guarantee on edges. Experiments on benchmark graph datasets
show that Eclipse achieves significantly better privacy-utility tradeoff
compared to existing privacy-preserving GNN training methods. In particular,
under strong privacy constraints ($\epsilon$ &lt; 4), Eclipse shows significant
gains in the model utility by up to 46%. We further demonstrate that Eclipse
also has better resilience against common edge attacks (e.g., LPA), lowering
the attack AUC by up to 5% compared to other state-of-the-art baselines.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10995v1'>2403.10995v1</a></div>

task. Given that KGs are usually incomplete, neural models are proposed to
solve CQA by performing multi-hop logical reasoning. However, most of them
cannot perform well on both one-hop and multi-hop queries simultaneously.
Recent work proposes a logical message passing mechanism based on the
pre-trained neural link predictors. While effective on both one-hop and
multi-hop queries, it ignores the difference between the constant and variable
nodes in a query graph. In addition, during the node embedding update stage,
this mechanism cannot dynamically measure the importance of different messages,
and whether it can capture the implicit logical dependencies related to a node
and received messages remains unclear. In this paper, we propose Conditional
Logical Message Passing Transformer (CLMPT), which considers the difference
between constants and variables in the case of using pre-trained neural link
predictors and performs message passing conditionally on the node type. We
empirically verified that this approach can reduce computational costs without
affecting performance. Furthermore, CLMPT uses the transformer to aggregate
received messages and update the corresponding node embedding. Through the
self-attention mechanism, CLMPT can assign adaptive weights to elements in an
input set consisting of received messages and the corresponding node and
explicitly model logical dependencies between various elements. Experimental
results show that CLMPT is a new state-of-the-art neural CQA model.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12954v1'>2402.12954v1</a></div>

anomaly is usually embodied in these relationships. Therefore, how to
comprehensively model complex interaction patterns in networks is still a major
focus. It can be observed that anomalies in networks violate the homophily
assumption. However, most existing studies only considered this phenomenon
obliquely rather than explicitly. Besides, the node representation of normal
entities can be perturbed easily by the noise relationships introduced by
anomalous nodes. To address the above issues, we present a novel contrastive
learning framework for anomaly detection on attributed networks,
\textbf{SCALA}, aiming to improve the embedding quality of the network and
provide a new measurement of qualifying the anomaly score for each node by
introducing sparsification into the conventional method. Extensive experiments

anonymous traffic and spam, have severely disrupted the smooth operation of
networks. Due to the inherent sender-receiver nature of network behaviors,
graph-based frameworks are commonly used for detecting anomalous behaviors.
However, in real-world scenarios, the boundary between normal and anomalous
behaviors tends to be ambiguous. The local heterophily of graphs interferes
with the detection, and existing methods based on nodes or edges introduce
unwanted noise into representation results, thereby impacting the effectiveness
of detection. To address these issues, we propose PhoGAD, a graph-based anomaly
detection framework. PhoGAD leverages persistent homology optimization to
clarify behavioral boundaries. Building upon this, the weights of adjacent
edges are designed to mitigate the effects of local heterophily. Subsequently,
to tackle the noise problem, we conduct a formal analysis and propose a
disentangled representation-based explicit embedding method, ultimately
achieving anomaly behavior detection. Experiments on intrusion, traffic, and
spam datasets verify that PhoGAD has surpassed the performance of
state-of-the-art (SOTA) frameworks in detection efficacy. Notably, PhoGAD
demonstrates robust detection even with diminished anomaly proportions,

clustering has become a popular area of research interest. Most of the existing
methods are only applicable to homophilous graphs, yet the extensive real-world
graph data can hardly fulfill the homophily assumption, where the connected
nodes tend to belong to the same class. Several studies have pointed out that
the poor performance on heterophilous graphs is actually due to the fact that
conventional graph neural networks (GNNs), which are essentially low-pass
filters, discard information other than the low-frequency information on the
graph. Nevertheless, on certain graphs, particularly heterophilous ones,
neglecting high-frequency information and focusing solely on low-frequency
information impedes the learning of node representations. To break this
limitation, our motivation is to perform graph filtering that is closely
related to the homophily degree of the given graph, with the aim of fully
leveraging both low-frequency and high-frequency signals to learn
distinguishable node embedding. In this work, we propose Adaptive Hybrid Graph
Filter for Multi-View Graph Clustering (AHGFC). Specifically, a graph joint
process and graph joint aggregation matrix are first designed by using the
intrinsic node features and adjacency relationship, which makes the low and
high-frequency signals on the graph more distinguishable. Then we design an
adaptive hybrid graph filter that is related to the homophily degree, which
learns the node embedding based on the graph joint aggregation matrix. After
that, the node embedding of each view is weighted and fused into a consensus
embedding for the downstream task. Experimental results show that our proposed
model performs well on six datasets containing homophilous and heterophilous

significantly limits their applicability in practice, since real-world graphs
exhibit a structural disparity and cannot simply be classified as homophily and
heterophily. Thus, a principled way to handle practical graphs is urgently
needed. To fill this gap, we provide a novel solution with theoretical support.
Interestingly, we find that most homophilic and heterophilic edges can be
correctly identified on the basis of neighbor information. Motivated by this
finding, we construct two graphs that are highly homophilic and heterophilic,
respectively. They are used to build low-pass and high-pass filters to capture
holistic information. Important features are further enhanced by the

extract low-frequency signals from graph topology, which may lead to the
over-smoothing problem when GCN goes deep. To this end, various methods have
been proposed to create an adaptive filter by incorporating an extra filter
(e.g., a high-pass filter) extracted from the graph topology. However, these
methods heavily rely on topological information and ignore the node attribute
space, which severely sacrifices the expressive power of the deep GCNs,
especially when dealing with disassortative graphs. In this paper, we propose a
cross-space adaptive filter, called CSF, to produce the adaptive-frequency
information extracted from both the topology and attribute spaces.
Specifically, we first derive a tailored attribute-based high-pass filter that
can be interpreted theoretically as a minimizer for semi-supervised kernel
ridge regression. Then, we cast the topology-based low-pass filter as a
Mercer's kernel within the context of GCNs. This serves as a foundation for
combining it with the attribute-based filter to capture the adaptive-frequency
information. Finally, we derive the cross-space filter via an effective
multiple-kernel learning strategy, which unifies the attribute-based high-pass
filter and the topology-based low-pass filter. This helps to address the
over-smoothing problem while maintaining effectiveness. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that CSF not only successfully alleviates the over-smoothing

standard in various deep learning domains, thanks to their flexibility in
modeling real-world phenomena represented as graphs. However, the
message-passing mechanism of GNNs faces challenges in learnability and
expressivity, hindering high performance on heterophilic graphs, where adjacent
nodes frequently have different labels. Most existing solutions addressing
these challenges are primarily confined to specific benchmarks focused on node
classification tasks. This narrow focus restricts the potential impact that
link prediction under heterophily could offer in several applications,

graph classification is not explicitly modeled, which is crucial since
different nodes may have different semantic relevance to graph classification;
2) the graph representation directly aggregated from node features may have

certain data modalities may perform better when predicting one class, while
others might excel in predicting a different class. Thus, to obtain a better

functional connectivity for distinguishing phenotypes from human brain
networks. However, obtaining extensive labeled clinical data for training is
often resource-intensive, making practical application difficult. Leveraging
unlabeled data thus becomes crucial for representation learning in a
label-scarce setting. Although generative self-supervised learning techniques,
especially masked autoencoders, have shown promising results in representation
learning in various domains, their application to dynamic graphs for dynamic
functional connectivity remains underexplored, facing challenges in capturing
high-level semantic representations. Here, we introduce the Spatio-Temporal
Joint Embedding Masked Autoencoder (ST-JEMA), drawing inspiration from the
Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) in computer vision. ST-JEMA
employs a JEPA-inspired strategy for reconstructing dynamic graphs, which
enables the learning of higher-level semantic representations considering
temporal perspectives, addressing the challenges in fMRI data representation
learning. Utilizing the large-scale UK Biobank dataset for self-supervised
learning, ST-JEMA shows exceptional representation learning performance on
dynamic functional connectivity demonstrating superiority over previous methods
in predicting phenotypes and psychiatric diagnoses across eight benchmark fMRI
datasets even with limited samples and effectiveness of temporal reconstruction
on missing data scenarios. These findings highlight the potential of our
approach as a robust representation learning method for leveraging label-scarce
fMRI data.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06432v1'>2403.06432v1</a></div>

the first postnatal year is pivotal for identifying the dynamics of early brain
connectivity development. Existing deep learning solutions suffer from three
major limitations. First, they cannot generalize to multi-trajectory prediction
tasks, where each graph trajectory corresponds to a particular imaging modality
or connectivity type (e.g., T1-w MRI). Second, existing models require
extensive training datasets to achieve satisfactory performance which are often
challenging to obtain. Third, they do not efficiently utilize incomplete time
series data. To address these limitations, we introduce FedGmTE-Net++, a
federated graph-based multi-trajectory evolution network. Using the power of
federation, we aggregate local learnings among diverse hospitals with limited
datasets. As a result, we enhance the performance of each hospital's local
generative model, while preserving data privacy. The three key innovations of
FedGmTE-Net++ are: (i) presenting the first federated learning framework
specifically designed for brain multi-trajectory evolution prediction in a
data-scarce environment, (ii) incorporating an auxiliary regularizer in the
local objective function to exploit all the longitudinal brain connectivity
within the evolution trajectory and maximize data utilization, (iii)
introducing a two-step imputation process, comprising a preliminary KNN-based
precompletion followed by an imputation refinement step that employs regressors
to improve similarity scores and refine imputations. Our comprehensive
experimental results showed the outperformance of FedGmTE-Net++ in brain
multi-trajectory prediction from a single baseline graph in comparison with
benchmark methods.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01383v2'>2401.01383v2</a></div>

aiding clinicians in planning appropriate treatment, reducing cancer-related
medical expenses, and significantly enhancing patients' quality of life.
Multimodal prediction of cancer patient survival offers a more comprehensive
and precise approach. However, existing methods still grapple with challenges
related to missing multimodal data and information interaction within
modalities. This paper introduces SELECTOR, a heterogeneous graph-aware network
based on convolutional mask encoders for robust multimodal prediction of cancer
patient survival. SELECTOR comprises feature edge reconstruction, convolutional
mask encoder, feature cross-fusion, and multimodal survival prediction modules.
Initially, we construct a multimodal heterogeneous graph and employ the
meta-path method for feature edge reconstruction, ensuring comprehensive
incorporation of feature information from graph edges and effective embedding
of nodes. To mitigate the impact of missing features within the modality on
prediction accuracy, we devised a convolutional masked autoencoder (CMAE) to
process the heterogeneous graph post-feature reconstruction. Subsequently, the
feature cross-fusion module facilitates communication between modalities,
ensuring that output features encompass all features of the modality and
relevant information from other modalities. Extensive experiments and analysis
on six cancer datasets from TCGA demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both modality-missing and
intra-modality information-confirmed cases. Our codes are made available at

through coupled learning. In essence, GNNs, from an optimization perspective,
seek to learn a consensus and compromise embedding representation that balances
attribute and graph information, selectively exploring and retaining valid
information. To obtain a more comprehensive embedding representation of nodes,
a novel GNNs framework, dubbed Decoupled Graph Neural Networks (DGNN), is
introduced. DGNN explores distinctive embedding representations from the
attribute and graph spaces by decoupled terms. Considering that semantic graph,
constructed from attribute feature space, consists of different node connection
information and provides enhancement for the topological graph, both
topological and semantic graphs are combined for the embedding representation
learning. Further, structural consistency among attribute embedding and graph
embeddings is promoted to effectively remove redundant information and
establish soft connection. This involves promoting factor sharing for adjacency
reconstruction matrices, facilitating the exploration of a consensus and
high-level correlation. Finally, a more powerful and complete representation is
achieved through the concatenation of these embeddings. Experimental results
conducted on several graph benchmark datasets verify its superiority in node

and enhancing generalisation capabilities in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).
Existing graph augmentation methods mainly perturb the graph structures and are
usually limited to pairwise node relations. These methods cannot fully address
the complexities of real-world large-scale networks that often involve
higher-order node relations beyond only being pairwise. Meanwhile, real-world
graph datasets are predominantly modelled as simple graphs, due to the scarcity
of data that can be used to form higher-order edges. Therefore, reconfiguring
the higher-order edges as an integration into graph augmentation strategies
lights up a promising research path to address the aforementioned issues. In
this paper, we present Hyperedge Augmentation (HyperAug), a novel graph
augmentation method that constructs virtual hyperedges directly form the raw
data, and produces auxiliary node features by extracting from the virtual
hyperedge information, which are used for enhancing GNN performances on
downstream tasks. We design three diverse virtual hyperedge construction
strategies to accompany the augmentation scheme: (1) via graph statistics, (2)
from multiple data perspectives, and (3) utilising multi-modality. Furthermore,
to facilitate HyperAug evaluation, we provide 23 novel real-world graph
datasets across various domains including social media, biology, and
e-commerce. Our empirical study shows that HyperAug consistently and
significantly outperforms GNN baselines and other graph augmentation methods,
across a variety of application contexts, which clearly indicates that it can
effectively incorporate higher-order node relations into graph augmentation
methods for real-world complex networks.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13033v1'>2402.13033v1</a></div>
