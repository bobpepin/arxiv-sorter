bottleneck is increasingly shifting to memory bandwidth. Over the past 20
years, peak server hardware FLOPS has been scaling at 3.0x/2yrs, outpacing the
growth of DRAM and interconnect bandwidth, which have only scaled at 1.6 and

multiple edge devices to collaboratively train a model without disclosing their
raw data. However, several challenges hinder the practical implementation of
this approach, especially when devices and the server communicate over wireless
channels, as it suffers from communication and computation bottlenecks in this
case. By utilizing a communication-efficient framework, we propose a novel
zero-order (ZO) method with a one-point gradient estimator that harnesses the
nature of the wireless communication channel without requiring the knowledge of
the channel state coefficient. It is the first method that includes the
wireless channel in the learning algorithm itself instead of wasting resources
to analyze it and remove its impact. The two main difficulties of this work are
that in FL, the objective function is usually not convex, which makes the
extension of FL to ZO methods challenging, and that including the impact of
wireless channels requires extra attention. However, we overcome these
difficulties and comprehensively analyze the proposed zero-order federated
learning (ZOFL) framework. We establish its convergence theoretically, and we
prove a convergence rate of $O(\frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{K}})$ in the nonconvex
setting. We further demonstrate the potential of our algorithm with
experimental results, taking into account independent and identically
distributed (IID) and non-IID device data distributions.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17460v1'>2401.17460v1</a></div>

communication latency. In this paper, we address this discrepancy and present
ADFL, a novel Analog-Digital FL scheme: in each round, the parameter server
(PS) schedules each device to either upload its gradient via the analog OTA
scheme or transmit its quantized gradient over an orthogonal RB using the
``digital" scheme. Focusing on a single FL round, we cast the optimal
scheduling problem as the minimization of the mean squared error (MSE) on the
estimated global gradient at the PS, subject to a delay constraint, yielding
the optimal device scheduling configuration and quantization bits for the

BCJRNet has demonstrated resilience against inaccurate channel tap estimations
when applied to a time-invariant channel with ideal exponential decay profiles.
However, its generalization capabilities for practically-relevant time-varying
channels, where the receiver can only access incorrect channel parameters,
remain largely unexplored. The primary contribution of this paper is to expand
upon the results from existing literature to encompass a variety of imperfect
channel knowledge cases that appear in real-world transmissions. Our findings
demonstrate that BCJRNet significantly outperforms the conventional BCJR
algorithm for stationary transmission scenarios when learning from noisy
channel data and with imperfect channel decay profiles. However, this advantage
is shown to diminish when the operating channel is also rapidly time-varying.
Our results also show the importance of memory assumptions for conventional
BCJR and BCJRNet. An underestimation of the memory largely degrades the
performance of both BCJR and BCJRNet, especially in a slow-decaying channel. To
mimic a situation closer to a practical scenario, we also combined channel tap
uncertainty with imperfect channel memory knowledge. Somewhat surprisingly, our

multiple task-specific decoders at the receiver, collectively trained to handle
diverse tasks including semantic information preservation, source input

applicability from point-to-point links to multi-receiver settings, we envision
the deployment of decoders at various receivers, where decentralized learning
addresses the challenges of communication load and privacy concerns, leveraging
federated learning techniques that distribute model updates across
decentralized nodes. However, the efficacy of this approach is contingent on
the robustness of the employed deep learning models. We scrutinize potential
vulnerabilities stemming from adversarial attacks during both training and

highlighting the importance of fortifying semantic communications against
potential multi-domain exploits. Overall, the joint and robust design of

applications due to its inefficiency and unreliability. To address this issue,
this paper proposes a deep joint source-channel coding (DJSCC) scheme to enable
efficient and reliable CTC. The proposed scheme builds a neural-network-based
encoder and decoder at the sender side and the receiver side, respectively, to
achieve two critical tasks simultaneously: 1) compressing the messages to the
point where only their essential semantic meanings are preserved; 2) ensuring
the robustness of the semantic meanings when they are transmitted across
incompatible technologies. The scheme incorporates existing CTC coding
algorithms as domain knowledge to guide the encoder-decoder pair to learn the
characteristics of CTC links better. Moreover, the scheme constructs shared
semantic knowledge for the encoder and decoder, allowing semantic meanings to
be converted into very few bits for cross-technology transmissions, thus
further improving the efficiency of CTC. Extensive simulations verify that the
proposed scheme can reduce the transmission overhead by up to 97.63\% and
increase the structural similarity index measure by up to 734.78%, compared

New Radio (NR) air interface, crucial for the initial access procedure of
Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs), and serves several key purposes in the

transmission, including the Primary and Secondary Synchronization Signals (PSS

executed without requiring high power or complex equipment, pose substantial
risks to the 5G network, particularly as a result of the unencrypted
transmission of control signals. Leveraging RF domain knowledge, this work
presents a novel deep learning-based technique for detecting jammers in CAV

detector by focusing on the SSB. The detection method is focused on RF domain
features and improves the robustness of the network without requiring
integration with the pre-existing network infrastructure. By integrating a
preprocessing block to extract PSS correlation and energy per null resource

jammed received signals with high precision. Additionally, by incorporating of
Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), the efficacy of training and detection are
optimized. A double-threshold double Deep Neural Network (DT-DDNN) is also
introduced to the architecture complemented by a deep cascade learning model to
increase the sensitivity of the model to variations of signal-to-jamming noise

operation on a window of CAN messages with the reception, the model is able to
meet line-rate detection (0.43 ms per window) of high-speed CAN, which when
coupled with the low energy consumption per inference, makes this architecture

non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) datasets, where multiple
devices participate in the aggregation with time limitations and a finite
number of sub-channels. A detailed theoretical analysis of the generalization
gap that measures the degree of non-IID in the data distribution is presented.
Following that, solutions to address the challenges posed by non-IID conditions
are proposed with the analysis of the properties. Specifically, users' data
distributions are parameterized as concentration parameters and grouped using
spectral clustering, with Dirichlet distribution serving as the prior. The
investigation into the generalization gap and convergence rate guides the
design of sub-channel assignments through the matching-based algorithm, and the
power allocation is achieved by Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions with the
derived closed-form solution. The extensive simulation results show that the

uncertainty scenarios. Therefore, an efficient approach is required to maximize
the quality of service while considering all technical constraints. One of
these approaches is machine learning, which emulates optimal solutions for
application placement in edge servers. Machine learning models are expected to
learn how to allocate user requests to servers based on the spatial positions
of users and servers. In this study, the problem is formulated as a two-stage
stochastic programming. A sufficient amount of training records is generated by
varying parameters such as user locations, their request rates, and solving the
optimization model. Then, based on the distance features of each user from the
available servers and their request rates, machine learning models generate
decision variables for the first stage of the stochastic optimization model,
which is the user-to-server request allocation, and are employed as independent
decision agents that reliably mimic the optimization model. Support Vector
Machines (SVM) and Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) are used in this research to
achieve practical decisions from the stochastic optimization models. The

The local models are then shared and combined to form a global model capable of
making accurate predictions on new data. Our exploration focuses on how
different types of network structures influence the spreading of knowledge -
the process by which nodes incorporate insights gained from learning patterns
in data available on other nodes across the network. Specifically, this study
investigates the intricate interplay between network structure and learning
performance using three network topologies and six data distribution methods.
These methods consider different vertex properties, including degree
centrality, betweenness centrality, and clustering coefficient, along with
whether nodes exhibit high or low values of these metrics. Our findings
underscore the significance of global centrality metrics (degree, betweenness)
in correlating with learning performance, while local clustering proves less
predictive. We highlight the challenges in transferring knowledge from
peripheral to central nodes, attributed to a dilution effect during model
aggregation. Additionally, we observe that central nodes exert a pull effect,
facilitating the spread of knowledge. In examining degree distribution, hubs in
Barabasi-Albert networks positively impact learning for central nodes but
exacerbate dilution when knowledge originates from peripheral nodes. Finally,

privacy and model compression generally must trade off utility loss to achieve
their objectives. Moreover, concurrently achieving both can result in even more
utility loss. To this end, we propose a novel differentially private knowledge

onto the student in two ways: one way from the synthetic data itself, the hard

evaluated on the synthetic data, the soft labels. Furthermore, if the teacher

have revolutionized natural language processing and search engine dynamics.
However, these models incur exceptionally high computational costs. For
instance, GPT-3 consists of 175 billion parameters and inference on these
models also demands billions of floating-point operations. Caching is a natural
solution to reduce LLM inference costs on repeated queries. However, existing
caching methods are incapable of finding semantic similarities among LLM
queries, leading to unacceptable false hit-and-miss rates.
  This paper introduces MeanCache, a semantic cache for LLMs that identifies
semantically similar queries to determine cache hit or miss. Using MeanCache,
the response to a user's semantically similar query can be retrieved from a
local cache rather than re-querying the LLM, thus reducing costs, service
provider load, and environmental impact. MeanCache leverages Federated Learning
(FL) to collaboratively train a query similarity model in a distributed manner
across numerous users without violating privacy. By placing a local cache in
each user's device and using FL, MeanCache reduces the latency and costs and
enhances model performance, resulting in lower cache false hit rates. Our
experiments, benchmarked against the GPTCache, reveal that MeanCache attains an
approximately 17% higher F-score and a 20% increase in precision during
semantic cache hit-and-miss decisions. Furthermore, MeanCache reduces the
storage requirement by 83% and accelerates semantic cache hit-and-miss
decisions by 11%, while still surpassing GPTCache.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02694v1'>2403.02694v1</a></div>

However, recent research proposed poisoning attacks that cause a catastrophic
loss in the accuracy of the global model when adversaries, posed as benign
clients, are present in a group of clients. Therefore, recent studies suggested
byzantine-robust FL methods that allow the server to train an accurate global
model even with the adversaries present in the system. However, many existing

the private dataset was non-independently and identically distributed

utilizing the contrastive learning technique, which showed a tremendous

design FLGuard as an ensemble scheme to maximize the defensive capability. We

different data-poisoning attacks.
  In this study, our motivation is to explore the severity of data poisoning
attacks in the computer network domain because they are easy to implement but
difficult to detect. We considered two types of data-poisoning attacks, label
flipping (LF) and feature poisoning (FP), and applied them with a novel
approach. In LF, we randomly flipped the labels of benign data and trained the
model on the manipulated data. For FP, we randomly manipulated the highly
contributing features determined using the Random Forest algorithm. The
datasets used in this experiment were CIC and UNSW related to computer
networks. We generated adversarial samples using the two attacks mentioned
above, which were applied to a small percentage of datasets. Subsequently, we
trained and tested the accuracy of the model on adversarial datasets. We
recorded the results for both benign and manipulated datasets and observed
significant differences between the accuracy of the models on different
datasets. From the experimental results, it is evident that the LF attack
failed, whereas the FP attack showed effective results, which proved its
significance in fooling a server. With a 1% LF attack on the CIC, the accuracy
was approximately 0.0428 and the ASR was 0.9564; hence, the attack is easily
detectable, while with a 1% FP attack, the accuracy and ASR were both
approximately 0.9600, hence, FP attacks are difficult to detect. We repeated

diverse clients to participate in a unified model training. Existing methods
for assessing client contribution adopts co-operative game-theoretic concepts,
such as Shapley values, but under simplified assumptions. In this paper, we
propose a history-aware game-theoretic framework, called FLContrib, to assess

specific clients or data points on the global model learned via federated
learning (FL). This problem is driven by the right to be forgotten and the
privacy challenges in FL. We introduce a new framework for exact federated
unlearning that meets two essential criteria: \textit{communication efficiency}
and \textit{exact unlearning provability}. To our knowledge, this is the first
work to tackle both aspects coherently. We start by giving a rigorous
definition of \textit{exact} federated unlearning, which guarantees that the
unlearned model is statistically indistinguishable from the one trained without
the deleted data. We then pinpoint the key property that enables fast exact
federated unlearning: total variation (TV) stability, which measures the
sensitivity of the model parameters to slight changes in the dataset.
Leveraging this insight, we develop a TV-stable FL algorithm called
\texttt{FATS}, which modifies the classical
\texttt{\underline{F}ed\underline{A}vg} algorithm for \underline{T}V
\underline{S}tability and employs local SGD with periodic averaging to lower
the communication round. We also design efficient unlearning algorithms for
\texttt{FATS} under two settings: client-level and sample-level unlearning. We
provide theoretical guarantees for our learning and unlearning algorithms,
proving that they achieve exact federated unlearning with reasonable
convergence rates for both the original and unlearned models. We empirically
validate our framework on 6 benchmark datasets, and show its superiority over
state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, communication cost, computation
cost, and unlearning efficacy.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11018v1'>2401.11018v1</a></div>

different clients by exchanging parameters instead of direct data sharing,
which mitigates the privacy leak incurred by machine learning. However, FL
still suffers from membership inference attacks (MIA) or data reconstruction
attacks (DRA). In particular, an attacker can extract the information from
local datasets by constructing DRA, which cannot be effectively throttled by
existing techniques, e.g., Differential Privacy (DP).
  In this paper, we aim to ensure a strong privacy guarantee for FL under DRA.
We prove that reconstruction errors under DRA are constrained by the
information acquired by an attacker, which means that constraining the
transmitted information can effectively throttle DRA. To quantify the
information leakage incurred by FL, we establish a channel model, which depends
on the upper bound of joint mutual information between the local dataset and
multiple transmitted parameters. Moreover, the channel model indicates that the
transmitted information can be constrained through data space operation, which
can improve training efficiency and the model accuracy under constrained
information. According to the channel model, we propose algorithms to constrain
the information transmitted in a single round of local training. With a limited
number of training rounds, the algorithms ensure that the total amount of
transmitted information is limited. Furthermore, our channel model can be
applied to various privacy-enhancing techniques (such as DP) to enhance privacy
guarantees against DRA. Extensive experiments with real-world datasets validate

of local gradient results along with engineered queries to the clients.
However, quantum communication channels are considered more secure because a
measurement on the channel causes a loss of information, which can be detected
by the sender. Therefore, the quantum version of federated learning can be used
to provide more privacy. Additionally, sending an $N$ dimensional data vector
through a quantum channel requires sending $\log N$ entangled qubits, which can
potentially provide exponential efficiency if the data vector is utilized as
quantum states.
  In this paper, we propose a quantum federated learning model where fixed
design quantum chips are operated based on the quantum states sent by a
centralized server. Based on the coming superposition states, the clients
compute and then send their local gradients as quantum states to the server,
where they are aggregated to update parameters. Since the server does not send
model parameters, but instead sends the operator as a quantum state, the
clients are not required to share the model. This allows for the creation of
asynchronous learning models. In addition, the model as a quantum state is fed
into client-side chips directly; therefore, it does not require measurements on
the upcoming quantum state to obtain model parameters in order to compute
gradients. This can provide efficiency over the models where the parameter
vector is sent via classical or quantum channels and local gradients are
obtained through the obtained values of these parameters.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13421v2'>2401.13421v2</a></div>

clients manipulate their updates to affect the global model. Although various
methods exist for detecting those clients in FL, identifying malicious clients
requires sufficient model updates, and hence by the time malicious clients are
detected, FL models have been already poisoned. Thus, a method is needed to
recover an accurate global model after malicious clients are identified.
Current recovery methods rely on (i) all historical information from
participating FL clients and (ii) the initial model unaffected by the malicious
clients, leading to a high demand for storage and computational resources. In
this paper, we show that highly effective recovery can still be achieved based
on (i) selective historical information rather than all historical information
and (ii) a historical model that has not been significantly affected by
malicious clients rather than the initial model. In this scenario, while
maintaining comparable recovery performance, we can accelerate the recovery
speed and decrease memory consumption. Following this concept, we introduce
Crab, an efficient and certified recovery method, which relies on selective
information storage and adaptive model rollback. Theoretically, we demonstrate
that the difference between the global model recovered by Crab and the one
recovered by train-from-scratch can be bounded under certain assumptions. Our
empirical evaluation, conducted across three datasets over multiple machine
learning models, and a variety of untargeted and targeted poisoning attacks
reveals that Crab is both accurate and efficient, and consistently outperforms
previous approaches in terms of both recovery speed and memory consumption.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08216v2'>2401.08216v2</a></div>

participants whose objective is to infer private training data of other

Brave is Byzantine-resilient, which guarantees that all benign participants
converge to an identical model that deviates from a global model trained

classical crowdsourced ML, participants deliberately specialize their efforts
by working on subproblems, such as demographic subgroups in the service of
fairness. Here, we take a broader perspective on this work: we note that within
this framework, participants may both specialize in the service of fairness and

bird species in an image classification task). Unlike traditional
crowdsourcing, this allows for the diversification of participants' efforts and

So far, at least three metrics have been proposed to compare the performances
of these techniques [33, 8, 3]. However, different metrics lead to divergent

to a classification rule biased toward the sensitive attribute outcome holding

framework for achieving causal fairness based on the notion of interventions

modeling fair prediction using a Partially Directed Acyclic Graph (PDAG),

collaboration approach. A typical heuristic estimates the expected harmfulness
of a post and uses fixed thresholds to decide whether to remove it and whether
to send it for human review. This disregards the prediction uncertainty, the
time-varying element of human review capacity and post arrivals, and the
selective sampling in the dataset (humans only review posts filtered by the
admission algorithm).
  In this paper, we introduce a model to capture the human-AI interplay in
content moderation. The algorithm observes contextual information for incoming
posts, makes classification and admission decisions, and schedules posts for
human review. Only admitted posts receive human reviews on their harmfulness.
These reviews help educate the machine-learning algorithms but are delayed due
to congestion in the human review system. The classical learning-theoretic way
to capture this human-AI interplay is via the framework of learning to defer,
where the algorithm has the option to defer a classification task to humans for
a fixed cost and immediately receive feedback. Our model contributes to this
literature by introducing congestion in the human review system. Moreover,
unlike work on online learning with delayed feedback where the delay in the
feedback is exogenous to the algorithm's decisions, the delay in our model is
endogenous to both the admission and the scheduling decisions.
  We propose a near-optimal learning algorithm that carefully balances the
classification loss from a selectively sampled dataset, the idiosyncratic loss
of non-reviewed posts, and the delay loss of having congestion in the human
review system. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result for
online learning in contextual queueing systems and hence our analytical

propose a framework that views trustworthy ML as a multi-objective multi-agent
optimization problem. This naturally lends itself to a game-theoretic
formulation we call regulation games. We illustrate a particular game instance,
the SpecGame in which we model the relationship between an ML model builder and
fairness and privacy regulators. Regulators wish to design penalties that
enforce compliance with their specification, but do not want to discourage
builders from participation. Seeking such socially optimal (i.e., efficient for
all agents) solutions to the game, we introduce ParetoPlay. This novel
equilibrium search algorithm ensures that agents remain on the Pareto frontier
of their objectives and avoids the inefficiencies of other equilibria.
Simulating SpecGame through ParetoPlay can provide policy guidance for ML
Regulation. For instance, we show that for a gender classification application,
regulators can enforce a differential privacy budget that is on average 4.0
lower if they take the initiative to specify their desired guarantee first.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03540v1'>2402.03540v1</a></div>

including transportation, healthcare, energy, and banking which could be
detrimental to business operations. Consequently, the detection of these URLs
is of crucial importance; however, current Machine Learning (ML) models are
susceptible to backdoor attacks. These attacks involve manipulating a small
percentage of training data labels, such as Label Flipping (LF), which changes
benign labels to malicious ones and vice versa. This manipulation results in
misclassification and leads to incorrect model behavior. Therefore, integrating
defense mechanisms into the architecture of ML models becomes an imperative
consideration to fortify against potential attacks.
  The focus of this study is on backdoor attacks in the context of URL
detection using ensemble trees. By illuminating the motivations behind such
attacks, highlighting the roles of attackers, and emphasizing the critical
importance of effective defense strategies, this paper contributes to the
ongoing efforts to fortify ML models against adversarial threats within the ML
domain in network security. We propose an innovative alarm system that detects
the presence of poisoned labels and a defense mechanism designed to uncover the
original class labels with the aim of mitigating backdoor attacks on ensemble
tree classifiers. We conducted a case study using the Alexa and Phishing Site
URL datasets and showed that LF attacks can be addressed using our proposed
defense mechanism. Our experimental results prove that the LF attack achieved
an Attack Success Rate (ASR) between 50-65% within 2-5%, and the innovative

benchmark of multiple decision tree ensembles with constrained adversarial
examples generated from standard datasets. The robustness of regularly and

range of cyber threats. Ensuring robust protection against these threats
necessitates the implementation of an effective Intrusion Detection System
(IDS). For more than a decade, researchers have delved into supervised machine
learning techniques to develop IDS to classify normal and attack traffic.
However, building effective IDS models using supervised learning requires a
substantial number of benign and attack samples. To collect a sufficient number
of attack samples from real-life scenarios is not possible since cyber attacks
occur occasionally. Further, IDS trained and tested on known datasets fails in
detecting zero-day or unknown attacks due to the swift evolution of attack
patterns. To address this challenge, we put forth two strategies for
semi-supervised learning based IDS where training samples of attacks are not
required: 1) training a supervised machine learning model using randomly and
uniformly dispersed synthetic attack samples; 2) building a One Class
Classification (OCC) model that is trained exclusively on benign network
traffic. We have implemented both approaches and compared their performances
using 10 recent benchmark IDS datasets. Our findings demonstrate that the OCC

measures and tools. The Network Intrusion Detection System (IDS) acts as a
primary tool against such cyber threats. However, machine learning-based IDSs,
when trained on specific attack patterns, often misclassify new emerging
cyberattacks. Further, the limited availability of attack instances for
training a supervised learner and the ever-evolving nature of cyber threats
further complicate the matter. This emphasizes the need for an adaptable IDS
framework capable of recognizing and learning from unfamiliar/unseen attacks
over time. In this research, we propose a one-class classification-driven IDS
system structured on two tiers. The first tier distinguishes between normal
activities and attacks/threats, while the second tier determines if the
detected attack is known or unknown. Within this second tier, we also embed a
multi-classification mechanism coupled with a clustering algorithm. This model
not only identifies unseen attacks but also uses them for retraining them by
clustering unseen attacks. This enables our model to be future-proofed, capable
of evolving with emerging threat patterns. Leveraging one-class classifiers
(OCC) at the first level, our approach bypasses the need for attack samples,
addressing data imbalance and zero-day attack concerns and OCC at the second

To safeguard critical infrastructures from these emerging threats, it is
crucial to deploy an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that can detect different
types of attacks accurately while minimizing false alarms. Machine learning
approaches have been used extensively in IDS and they are mainly using flat
multi-class classification to differentiate normal traffic and different types
of attacks. Though cyberattack types exhibit a hierarchical structure where
similar granular attack subtypes can be grouped into more high-level attack
types, hierarchical classification approach has not been explored well. In this
paper, we investigate the effectiveness of hierarchical classification approach
in IDS. We use a three-level hierarchical classification model to classify
various network attacks, where the first level classifies benign or attack, the
second level classifies coarse high-level attack types, and the third level
classifies a granular level attack types. Our empirical results of using 10
different classification algorithms in 10 different datasets show that there is
no significant difference in terms of overall classification performance (i.e.,
detecting normal and different types of attack correctly) of hierarchical and
flat classification approaches. However, flat classification approach
misclassify attacks as normal whereas hierarchical approach misclassify one
type of attack as another attack type. In other words, the hierarchical
classification approach significantly minimises attacks from misclassified as
normal traffic, which is more important in critical systems.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13013v1'>2403.13013v1</a></div>

the solutions for handling unknown classes is to retrain the model, however,
retraining models every time they become obsolete is both resource and
time-consuming. Therefore, there is a growing need to allow classification
models to detect and adapt to new classes dynamically, without retraining, but
instead able to detect new classes using few shots learning [1]. In this paper,
we introduce Adaptive Classification By Retrieval CBR, a novel approach for

This paper focuses on a method for recognizing and identifying ransomware in

internet or any system that connects computers. Analyzing and understanding
network traffic is vital for improving network security and management.
However, the analysis of network traffic is challenging due to the diverse
nature of data packets, which often feature heterogeneous headers and encrypted
payloads lacking semantics. To capture the latent semantics of traffic, a few
studies have adopted pre-training techniques based on the Transformer encoder
or decoder to learn the representations from massive traffic data. However,
these methods typically excel in traffic understanding (classification) or
traffic generation tasks. To address this issue, we develop Lens, a foundation
model for network traffic that leverages the T5 architecture to learn the
pre-trained representations from large-scale unlabeled data. Harnessing the
strength of the encoder-decoder framework, which captures the global
information while preserving the generative ability, our model can better learn
the representations from raw data. To further enhance pre-training
effectiveness, we design a novel loss that combines three distinct tasks:
Masked Span Prediction (MSP), Packet Order Prediction (POP), and Homologous
Traffic Prediction (HTP). Evaluation results across various benchmark datasets
demonstrate that the proposed Lens outperforms the baselines in most downstream
tasks related to both traffic understanding and generation. Notably, it also
requires much less labeled data for fine-tuning compared to current methods.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03646v2'>2402.03646v2</a></div>

Moreover, they train the packet-level and flow-level classification tasks

the packet-level task can be exploited by the flow-level task. Therefore, in
this paper, we propose an effective model named a Contrastive Learning Enhanced

significantly. From traditional statistical methods, the field has progressed

dependence on labeled data for analysis and the difficulty of generating
traffic samples that follow realistic patterns. Pre-trained deep neural
networks have emerged as powerful tools to resolve these issues, offering
improved performance by learning robust data representations from large

various classification problems across many mission-critical applications

about the unfairness and discrimination of data-driven classification models,
which is inevitable for classical algorithms including AdaBoost. In order to
achieve fair classification, a novel fair AdaBoost (FAB) approach is proposed
that is an interpretable fairness-improving variant of AdaBoost. We mainly
investigate binary classification problems and focus on the fairness of three
different indicators (i.e., accuracy, false positive rate and false negative
rate). By utilizing a fairness-aware reweighting technique for base
classifiers, the proposed FAB approach can achieve fair classification while
maintaining the advantage of AdaBoost with negligible sacrifice of predictive
performance. In addition, a hyperparameter is introduced in FAB to show
preferences for the fairness-accuracy trade-off. An upper bound for the target
loss function that quantifies error rate and unfairness is theoretically
derived for FAB, which provides a strict theoretical support for the
fairness-improving methods designed for AdaBoost. The effectiveness of the
proposed method is demonstrated on three real-world datasets (i.e., Adult,
COMPAS and HSLS) with respect to the three fairness indicators. The results are
accordant with theoretic analyses, and show that (i) FAB significantly improves
classification fairness at a small cost of accuracy compared with AdaBoost; and

available only with an aggregate response, providing a summary of individuals'
responses in that bag. In this paper, we study two natural loss functions for
learning from aggregate responses: bag-level loss and the instance-level loss.
In the former, the model is learnt by minimizing a loss between aggregate

to fit individual predictions to the aggregate responses. In this work, we show
that the instance-level loss can be perceived as a regularized form of the

empirical risk minimization (ERM) is suboptimal, was a major open problem in

years ago. Unfortunately, Hanneke's algorithm is quite complex as it returns
the majority vote of many ERM classifiers that are trained on carefully
selected subsets of the data. It is thus a natural goal to determine the
simplest algorithm that is optimal. In this work we study the arguably simplest
algorithm that could be optimal: returning the majority vote of three ERM
classifiers. We show that this algorithm achieves the optimal in-expectation
bound on its error which is provably unattainable by a single ERM classifier.
Furthermore, we prove a near-optimal high-probability bound on this algorithm's

that when all group-level co-variance is in the medium regime and all mean are
close to zero, the learning performance is most desirable in the sense of a
small sample complexity, a fast training rate, and a high average and

trained and evaluated on patient data from a single source, such as a hospital.
Cross-validation methods can be used to estimate the accuracy of such models on
new patients originating from the same source, by repeated random splitting of
the data. However, such estimates tend to be highly overoptimistic when
compared to accuracy obtained from deploying models to sources not represented
in the dataset, such as a new hospital. The increasing availability of
multi-source medical datasets provides new opportunities for obtaining more
comprehensive and realistic evaluations of expected accuracy through
source-level cross-validation designs.
  In this study, we present a systematic empirical evaluation of standard
K-fold cross-validation and leave-source-out cross-validation methods in a
multi-source setting. We consider the task of electrocardiogram based
cardiovascular disease classification, combining and harmonizing the openly
available PhysioNet CinC Challenge 2021 and the Shandong Provincial Hospital
datasets for our study.
  Our results show that K-fold cross-validation, both on single-source and
multi-source data, systemically overestimates prediction performance when the
end goal is to generalize to new sources. Leave-source-out cross-validation
provides more reliable performance estimates, having close to zero bias though
larger variability. The evaluation highlights the dangers of obtaining
misleading cross-validation results on medical data and demonstrates how these
issues can be mitigated when having access to multi-source data.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15012v1'>2403.15012v1</a></div>

model that addresses the challenges of the fat-data problem when dealing with
clinical prospective studies. The fat-data problem refers to the limitations of
Machine Learning (ML) algorithms when working with databases in which the
number of features is much larger than the number of samples (a common scenario
in certain medical fields). To overcome such limitations, the RFVM incorporates
different characteristics: (1) A Bayesian formulation which enables the model
to infer its parameters without overfitting thanks to the Bayesian model
averaging. (2) A joint optimisation that overcomes the limitations arising from
the fat-data characteristic by simultaneously including the variables that
define the primal space (features) and those that define the dual space
(observations). (3) An integrated prunning that removes the irrelevant features
and samples during the training iterative optimization. Also, this last point
turns out crucial when performing medical prospective studies, enabling
researchers to exclude unnecessary medical tests, reducing costs and
inconvenience for patients, and identifying the critical patients/subjects that
characterize the disorder and, subsequently, optimize the patient recruitment
process that leads to a balanced cohort. The model capabilities are tested
against state-of-the-art models in several medical datasets with fat-data
problems. These experimental works show that RFVM is capable of achieving
competitive classification accuracies while providing the most compact subset
of data (in both terms of features and samples). Moreover, the selected
features (medical tests) seem to be aligned with the existing medical
literature.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07079v1'>2402.07079v1</a></div>

a newly defined optimization problem that integrates logistic loss and

To address the minimization procedure, we employ functional principal
components and develop a new adaptive version of the Dual Augmented Lagrangian
algorithm. The computational efficiency of FSFC enables handling
high-dimensional scenarios where the number of features may considerably exceed
the number of statistical units. Simulation experiments demonstrate that FSFC
outperforms other machine learning and deep learning methods in computational

mistake bound model and provide nearly tight answers.
  We demonstrate that the optimal mistake bound under bandit feedback is at
most $O(k)$ times higher than the optimal mistake bound in the full information

to the full information scenario, where adaptive and oblivious adversaries are

involves agents strategically modifying their features in an effort to receive
favorable predictions. For instance, given a classifier determining loan
approval based on credit scores, applicants may open or close their credit
cards to fool the classifier. The learning goal is to find a classifier robust
against strategic manipulations. Various settings, based on what and when
information is known, have been explored in strategic classification. In this
work, we focus on addressing a fundamental question: the learnability gaps
between strategic classification and standard learning.
  We essentially show that any learnable class is also strategically learnable:
we first consider a fully informative setting, where the manipulation structure
(which is modeled by a manipulation graph $G^\star$) is known and during
training time the learner has access to both the pre-manipulation data and
post-manipulation data. We provide nearly tight sample complexity and regret
bounds, offering significant improvements over prior results. Then, we relax
the fully informative setting by introducing two natural types of uncertainty.
First, following Ahmadi et al. (2023), we consider the setting in which the
learner only has access to the post-manipulation data. We improve the results
of Ahmadi et al. (2023) and close the gap between mistake upper bound and lower
bound raised by them. Our second relaxation of the fully informative setting
introduces uncertainty to the manipulation structure. That is, we assume that
the manipulation graph is unknown but belongs to a known class of graphs. We
provide nearly tight bounds on the learning complexity in various unknown
manipulation graph settings. Notably, our algorithm in this setting is of
independent interest and can be applied to other problems such as multi-label
learning.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19303v1'>2402.19303v1</a></div>

ideally obtain a positive classification from the learner's classifier. The
typical response of the learner is to carefully modify their classifier to be
robust to such strategic behavior. When reasoning about agent manipulations,
most papers that study strategic classification rely on the following strong
assumption: agents fully know the exact parameters of the deployed classifier
by the learner. This often is an unrealistic assumption when using complex or
proprietary machine learning techniques in real-world prediction tasks.
  We initiate the study of partial information release by the learner in
strategic classification. We move away from the traditional assumption that
agents have full knowledge of the classifier. Instead, we consider agents that
have a common distributional prior on which classifier the learner is using.
The learner in our model can reveal truthful, yet not necessarily complete,
information about the deployed classifier to the agents. The learner's goal is
to release just enough information about the classifier to maximize accuracy.
We show how such partial information release can, counter-intuitively, benefit
the learner's accuracy, despite increasing agents' abilities to manipulate.
  We show that while it is intractable to compute the best response of an agent
in the general case, there exist oracle-efficient algorithms that can solve the
best response of the agents when the learner's hypothesis class is the class of
linear classifiers, or when the agents' cost function satisfies a natural
notion of submodularity as we define. We then turn our attention to the
learner's optimization problem and provide both positive and negative results
on the algorithmic problem of how much information the learner should release
about the classifier to maximize their expected accuracy.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08758v1'>2402.08758v1</a></div>

approaches of increasing strategic awareness, we study the effects of
self-selection on learning, and the implications of learning on the composition

some reward such as service quality. On the flipside, users may strategically
choose which services to use in order to pursue their own reward functions, in
the process wielding power over which services can see and use their data.
Extensive prior research has been conducted on the effects of strategic users
in single-service settings, with strategic behavior manifesting in the
manipulation of observable features to achieve a desired classification;
however, this can often be costly or unattainable for users and fails to
capture the full behavior of multi-service dynamic systems. As such, we analyze
a setting in which strategic users choose among several available services in
order to pursue positive classifications, while services seek to minimize loss
functions on their observations. We focus our analysis on realizable settings,
and show that naive retraining can still lead to oscillation even if all users

recommendations continue to grow in scale and complexity with the recent surge
in the adoption of LLMs. Online model selection has thus garnered increasing
attention due to the need to choose the best model among a diverse set while
balancing task reward and exploration cost. Organizations faces decisions like
whether to employ a costly API-based LLM or a locally finetuned small LLM,
weighing cost against performance. Traditional selection methods often evaluate
every candidate model before choosing one, which are becoming impractical given
the rising costs of training and finetuning LLMs. Moreover, it is undesirable
to allocate excessive resources towards exploring poor-performing models. While
some recent works leverage online bandit algorithm to manage such
exploration-exploitation trade-off in model selection, they tend to overlook
the increasing-then-converging trend in model performances as the model is
iteratively finetuned, leading to less accurate predictions and suboptimal
model selections.
  In this paper, we propose a time-increasing bandit algorithm TI-UCB, which
effectively predicts the increase of model performances due to finetuning and
efficiently balances exploration and exploitation in model selection. To
further capture the converging points of models, we develop a change detection
mechanism by comparing consecutive increase predictions. We theoretically prove
that our algorithm achieves a logarithmic regret upper bound in a typical
increasing bandit setting, which implies a fast convergence rate. The advantage
of our method is also empirically validated through extensive experiments on
classification model selection and online selection of LLMs. Our results
highlight the importance of utilizing increasing-then-converging pattern for
more efficient and economic model selection in the deployment of LLMs.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07213v1'>2403.07213v1</a></div>

approach, which is an extension of the well-known FP-Growth algorithm,

a threshold value to denote the number of courses that each discovered rule

educational technologies, especially intelligent tutoring systems (ITS), aim to
address. In this context, the ZPDES algorithm, based on the Learning Progress
Hypothesis (LPH) and multi-armed bandit machine learning techniques, sequences
exercises that maximize learning progress (LP). This algorithm was previously
shown in field studies to boost learning performances for a wider diversity of
students compared to a hand-designed curriculum. However, its motivational
impact was not assessed. Also, ZPDES did not allow students to express choices.
This limitation in agency is at odds with the LPH theory concerned with
modeling curiosity-driven learning. We here study how the introduction of such
choice possibilities impact both learning efficiency and motivation. The given
choice concerns dimensions that are orthogonal to exercise difficulty, acting
as a playful feature.
  In an extensive field study (265 7-8 years old children, RCT design), we
compare systems based either on ZPDES or a hand-designed curriculum, both with
and without self-choice. We first show that ZPDES improves learning performance
and produces a positive and motivating learning experience. We then show that
the addition of choice triggers intrinsic motivation and reinforces the
learning effectiveness of the LP-based personalization. In doing so, it
strengthens the links between intrinsic motivation and performance progress
during the serious game. Conversely, deleterious effects of the playful feature
are observed for hand-designed linear paths. Thus, the intrinsic motivation
elicited by a playful feature is beneficial only if the curriculum
personalization is effective for the learner. Such a result deserves great

revisits the classical idea of spectrally transformed kernel regression (STKR),

exploits the data distribution for which unlabeled data can provide additional

i.e., identifying a subset of important and representative points. For example,
selecting the most significant samples in ML training cannot only reduce
training costs but also enhance model quality. Submodularity, a discrete
analogue of convexity, is commonly used for solving subset selection problems.
However, existing algorithms for optimizing submodular functions are
sequential, and the prior distributed methods require at least one central
machine to fit the target subset. In this paper, we relax the requirement of
having a central machine for the target subset by proposing a novel distributed
bounding algorithm with provable approximation guarantees. The algorithm
iteratively bounds the minimum and maximum utility values to select high
quality points and discard the unimportant ones. When bounding does not find
the complete subset, we use a multi-round, partition-based distributed greedy
algorithm to identify the remaining subset. We show that these algorithms find

multiprocessors. Our work is motivated by the need to solve submodular
optimization problems on massive data sets, for practical applications in areas
such as data summarization, machine learning, and graph sparsification. Our
work builds on the randomized distributed RandGreedI algorithm, proposed by
Barbosa, Ene, Nguyen, and Ward (2015). This algorithm computes a distributed
solution by randomly partitioning the data among all the processors and then
employing a single accumulation step in which all processors send their partial

could exceed the memory available on a processor, and the processor which
performs the accumulation could become a computational bottleneck.
  Here, we propose a generalization of the RandGreedI algorithm that employs
multiple accumulation steps to reduce the memory required. We analyze the
approximation ratio and the time complexity of the algorithm (in the BSP
model). We also evaluate the new GreedyML algorithm on three classes of

The results show that the GreedyML algorithm can solve problems where the
sequential Greedy and distributed RandGreedI algorithms fail due to memory

engines support a large number of analytic jobs processing huge volumes of data
on a daily basis, and workloads are often inundated with overlapping
computations across multiple jobs. Reusing common computation is crucial for
efficient cluster resource utilization and reducing job execution time.
Detecting common computation is the first and key step for reducing this
computational redundancy. However, detecting equivalence on large-scale
analytics engines requires efficient and scalable solutions that are fully
automated. In addition, to maximize computation reuse, equivalence needs to be
detected at the semantic level instead of just the syntactic level (i.e., the
ability to detect semantic equivalence of seemingly different-looking queries).
Unfortunately, existing solutions fall short of satisfying these requirements.
  In this paper, we take a major step towards filling this gap by proposing
GEqO, a portable and lightweight machine-learning-based framework for
efficiently identifying semantically equivalent computations at scale. GEqO
introduces two machine-learning-based filters that quickly prune out
nonequivalent subexpressions and employs a semi-supervised learning feedback
loop to iteratively improve its model with an intelligent sampling mechanism.
Further, with its novel database-agnostic featurization method, GEqO can
transfer the learning from one workload and database to another. Our extensive
empirical evaluation shows that, on TPC-DS-like queries, GEqO yields
significant performance gains-up to 200x faster than automated verifiers-and

keys and their corresponding positions in key-value indexes. These indexes use
the mapping information as training data. Learned indexes require frequent
retrainings of their models to incorporate the changes introduced by update
queries. To efficiently retrain the models, existing learned index systems
often harness a linear algebraic QR factorization technique that performs
matrix decomposition. This factorization approach processes all key-position
pairs during each retraining, resulting in compute operations that grow
linearly with the total number of keys and their lengths. Consequently, the
retrainings create a severe performance bottleneck, especially for
variable-length string keys, while the retrainings are crucial for maintaining
high prediction accuracy and in turn, ensuring low query service latency.
  To address this performance problem, we develop an algorithm-hardware

leverage a unique algorithmic property of the matrix decomposition-based
training method. Exploiting the property, we develop a memoization-based
incremental training scheme, which only requires computation over updated keys,
while decomposition results of non-updated keys from previous computations can
be reused. We further enhance SIA to offload a portion of this training process
to an FPGA accelerator to not only relieve CPU resources for serving index
queries (i.e., inference), but also accelerate the training itself. Our
evaluation shows that compared to ALEX, LIPP, and SIndex, a state-of-the-art

poses challenges in modeling for those with limited data, which can lead to
profound practical and ethical concerns. In this paper, we address a
representative case of data inequality problem across domains termed
Semi-Supervised Domain Generalization (SSDG), in which only one domain is
labeled while the rest are unlabeled. We propose a novel algorithm, ProUD,
which can effectively learn domain-invariant features via domain-aware
prototypes along with progressive generalization via uncertainty-adaptive
mixing of labeled and unlabeled domains. Our experiments on three different
benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of ProUD, outperforming all
baseline models including single domain generalization and semi-supervised
learning. Source code will be released upon acceptance of the paper.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05209v1'>2403.05209v1</a></div>

high-quality dataset can still attain a certain level of generalization
ability. Motivated by this, we propose a domain-adversarial active learning
(DAAL) algorithm for classification tasks in domain generalization. First, we
analyze that the objective of tasks is to maximize the inter-class distance
within the same domain and minimize the intra-class distance across different
domains. To achieve this objective, we design a domain adversarial selection
method that prioritizes challenging samples. Second, we posit that even in a
converged model, there are subsets of features that lack discriminatory power
within each domain. We attempt to identify these feature subsets and optimize
them by a constraint loss. We validate and analyze our DAAL algorithm on
multiple domain generalization datasets, comparing it with various domain

Previous work has shown that self-supervised contrastive pre-training improves
the robustness of the model on downstream tasks. However, in this paper, we
find that self-supervised models do not exhibit better generalization
performance than supervised models pre-trained on the same dataset in the DG
setting. We argue that this is owing to the fact that the richer intra-class
discriminative features extracted by self-supervised contrastive learning,
which we term silent features, are suppressed during supervised fine-tuning.
These silent features are likely to contain features that are more
generalizable on the test domain. In this work, we model and analyze this
feature suppression phenomenon and theoretically prove that preserving silent
features can achieve lower expected test domain risk under certain conditions.
In light of this, we propose a simple yet effective method termed STEP (Silent
Feature Preservation) to improve the generalization performance of the
self-supervised contrastive learning pre-trained model by alleviating the
suppression of silent features during the supervised fine-tuning process.

enhance inter-class separability by mixing between different classes
(inter-class mixup), they fall short in improving intra-class cohesion through
their mixing operations, limiting their classification performance. To tackle

significant improvements in DG, we highlight that there's still potential for
improvement in generalizing to unknown domains through the exploration on data

perturbed regions for domain generalization, coined Unknown Domain
Inconsistency Minimization (UDIM). UDIM reduces the loss landscape
inconsistency between source domain and unknown domains. As unknown domains are
inaccessible, these domains are empirically crafted by perturbing instances
from the source domain dataset. In particular, by aligning the loss landscape
acquired in the source domain to the loss landscape of perturbed domains, we
expect to achieve generalization grounded on these flat minima for the unknown

\textbf{federated models exhibit unreliability when faced with heterogeneous

uncertainty levels on out-of-distribution data. This unreliability is primarily
attributed to the presence of biased projection heads, which introduce
miscalibration into the federated models. Inspired by this observation, we

reliability of federated models. By treating the existing projection head
parameters as priors, APH randomly samples multiple initialized parameters of
projection heads from the prior and further performs targeted fine-tuning on
locally available data under varying learning rates. Such a head ensemble
introduces parameter diversity into the deterministic model, eliminating the
bias and producing reliable predictions via head averaging. We evaluate the
effectiveness of the proposed APH method across three prominent federated

distribution shift: poor extrapolation (e.g., they cannot generalize to a
different domain) and biases in the training data (e.g., they rely on spurious

mitigate poor extrapolation but not dataset biases. After providing theoretical
motivation and empirical evidence for this finding, we explore two of its

presence of both covariate and label shifts. Recently, Source-free Universal
Domain Adaptation (SF-UniDA) has emerged to achieve UniDA without access to
source data, which tends to be more practical due to data protection policies.
The main challenge lies in determining whether covariate-shifted samples belong
to target-private unknown categories. Existing methods tackle this either
through hand-crafted thresholding or by developing time-consuming iterative
clustering strategies. In this paper, we propose a new idea of LEArning
Decomposition (LEAD), which decouples features into source-known and -unknown
components to identify target-private data. Technically, LEAD initially
leverages the orthogonal decomposition analysis for feature decomposition.
Then, LEAD builds instance-level decision boundaries to adaptively identify
target-private data. Extensive experiments across various UniDA scenarios have
demonstrated the effectiveness and superiority of LEAD. Notably, in the OPDA
scenario on VisDA dataset, LEAD outperforms GLC by 3.5% overall H-score and
reduces 75% time to derive pseudo-labeling decision boundaries. Besides, LEAD
is also appealing in that it is complementary to most existing methods. The

knowledge from a large pre-trained teacher network, where both networks are

the student network may be required to perform in a new scenario (i.e., the
target domain), which usually exhibits significant differences from the known
scenario of the teacher network (i.e., the source domain). The traditional
domain adaptation techniques can be integrated with KD in a two-stage process
to bridge the domain gap, but the ultimate reliability of two-stage approaches
tends to be limited due to the high computational consumption and the
additional errors accumulated from both stages. To solve this problem, we
propose a new one-stage method dubbed ``Direct Distillation between Different
Domains" (4Ds). We first design a learnable adapter based on the Fourier
transform to separate the domain-invariant knowledge from the domain-specific
knowledge. Then, we build a fusion-activation mechanism to transfer the
valuable domain-invariant knowledge to the student network, while
simultaneously encouraging the adapter within the teacher network to learn the
domain-specific knowledge of the target data. As a result, the teacher network
can effectively transfer categorical knowledge that aligns with the target

matching, temperature scaling plays a pivotal role in knowledge distillation

drop instead temperature scaling on the student side, and systematically study
the resulting variant of KD, dubbed transformed teacher matching (TTM). By
reinterpreting temperature scaling as a power transform of probability

inherent R\'enyi entropy term in its objective function, which serves as an
extra regularization term. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that thanks
to this inherent regularization, TTM leads to trained students with better

Distillation (DFKD) methods have emerged as direct solutions. However, simply
adopting models derived from DFKD for real-world applications suffers
significant performance degradation, due to the discrepancy between teachers'
training data and real-world scenarios (student domain). The degradation stems
from the portions of teachers' knowledge that are not applicable to the student

performance. Hence, selectively transferring teachers' appropriate knowledge
becomes the primary challenge in DFKD. In this work, we propose a simple but

to the unavailability of validation data. Unfortunately, this paper has
discovered that existing DFKD methods are quite sensitive to different teacher
models, occasionally showing catastrophic failures of distillation, even when
using well-trained teacher models. Our observation is that the generator in
DFKD is not always guaranteed to produce precise yet diverse samples using the
existing representative strategy of minimizing both class-prior and adversarial

only decreases the diversity of generated samples, but also cannot completely
address the problem of generating unexpectedly low-quality samples depending on

the teacher model a lenient expert role for evaluating samples, rather than a
strict supervisor that enforces its class-prior on the generator. Specifically,
we design a sample selection approach that takes only clean samples verified by

between a teacher model to a student model. Existing work suffers from at least
one of the following key limitations in terms of direction and scope of
transfer which restrict its use: all knowledge is transferred from teacher to
student regardless of whether or not that knowledge is useful, the student is
the only one learning in this exchange, and typically distillation transfers
knowledge only from a single teacher to a single student. We formulate a novel
form of knowledge distillation in which many models can act as both students
and teachers which we call cooperative distillation. The models cooperate as
follows: a model (the student) identifies specific deficiencies in it's
performance and searches for another model (the teacher) who encodes learned
knowledge into instructional virtual instances via counterfactual instance
generation. Because different models may have different strengths and
weaknesses, all models can act as either students or teachers (cooperation)
when appropriate and only distill knowledge in areas specific to their
strengths (focus). Since counterfactuals as a paradigm are not tied to any
specific algorithm, we can use this method to distill knowledge between
learners of different architectures, algorithms, and even feature spaces. We
demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms baselines such as transfer
learning, self-supervised learning, and multiple knowledge distillation
algorithms on several datasets, but it can also be used in settings where the

more efficient for serving. Techniques from knowledge distillation may be
applied here, where the application model learns to mimic the foundation model.
However, specialized application models and foundation models have substantial

Prior domain generalization methods focus on extracting domain-invariant
features across several stationary domains to enable generalization to new
domains. However, in non-stationary tasks where new domains evolve in an
underlying continuous structure, such as time, merely extracting the invariant
features is insufficient for generalization to the evolving new domains.
Nevertheless, it is non-trivial to learn both evolving and invariant features
within a single model due to their conflicts. To bridge this gap, we build
causal models to characterize the distribution shifts concerning the two
patterns, and propose to learn both dynamic and invariant features via a new
framework called Mutual Information-Based Sequential Autoencoders (MISTS).
MISTS adopts information theoretic constraints onto sequential autoencoders to
disentangle the dynamic and invariant features, and leverage a domain adaptive
classifier to make predictions based on both evolving and invariant
information. Our experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate that MISTS succeeds in capturing both evolving and invariant
information, and present promising results in evolving domain generalization
tasks.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08464v1'>2401.08464v1</a></div>

approaches. This limitation arises from the erroneous empirical estimation of
$\gH$-divergence with few source domain samples. To tackle this problem, we

a generative network recalls past knowledge when necessary. In particular, to
maximize the stability of past knowledge, we investigate the complexity of

from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain for regression
tasks. Recent successful works in UDAR mostly focus on subspace alignment,
involving the alignment of a selected subspace within the entire feature space.
This contrasts with the feature alignment methods used for classification,
which aim at aligning the entire feature space and have proven effective but
are less so in regression settings. Specifically, while classification aims to
identify separate clusters across the entire embedding dimension, regression
induces less structure in the data representation, necessitating additional
guidance for efficient alignment. In this paper, we propose an effective method
for UDAR by incorporating guidance from uncertainty. Our approach serves a dual

regularization of the embedding space. Specifically, we leverage the Deep
Evidential Learning framework, which outputs both predictions and uncertainties
for each input sample. We propose aligning the parameters of higher-order
evidential distributions between the source and target domains using
traditional alignment methods at the feature or posterior level. Additionally,
we propose to augment the feature space representation by mixing source samples
with pseudo-labeled target samples based on label similarity. This cross-domain
mixing strategy produces more realistic samples than random mixing and
introduces higher uncertainty, facilitating further alignment. We demonstrate

the majority class, i.e. the class with many training samples, is mostly

expect that the biased classifier has learned to extract features mainly for
the majority classes and that the proportional energy of the activations mainly
reside in certain specific regions of the image where the attribute is located.
However, we find very little regular activation for samples of majority
classes, while the active regions for minority classes seem mostly reasonable

classification. The method offers adequate performance in many classification
problems, but it becomes inefficient when the data covariance matrix is
ill-conditioned. This often occurs when the feature space's dimensionality is
higher than or comparable to the training data size. Regularized LDA (RLDA)
methods based on regularized linear estimators of the data covariance matrix
have been proposed to cope with such a situation. The performance of RLDA
methods is well studied, with optimal regularization schemes already proposed.
In this paper, we investigate the capability of a positive semidefinite
ridge-type estimator of the inverse covariance matrix that coincides with a
nonlinear (NL) covariance matrix estimator. The estimator is derived by
reformulating the score function of the optimal classifier utilizing linear
estimation methods, which eventually results in the proposed NL-RLDA
classifier. We derive asymptotic and consistent estimators of the proposed
technique's misclassification rate under the assumptions of a double-asymptotic
regime and multivariate Gaussian model for the classes. The consistent
estimator, coupled with a one-dimensional grid search, is used to set the value
of the regularization parameter required for the proposed NL-RLDA classifier.
Performance evaluations based on both synthetic and real data demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed classifier. The proposed technique outperforms

settings the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and related methods are a powerful
tool in order to deal with the considered basis functions. For growing
dimensions the classical FFT-based methods become inefficient due to the curse
of dimensionality. Therefore, we restrict ourselves to multivariate basis
functions, each one of them depends only on a small number of dimensions. This
is motivated by the well-known sparsity of effects and recent results regarding
the reconstruction of functions from scattered data in terms of truncated
analysis of variance (ANOVA) decomposition, which makes the resulting model
even interpretable in terms of importance of the features as well as their
couplings. The usage of small superposition dimensions has the consequence that
the computational effort no longer grows exponentially but only polynomially
with respect to the dimension. In order to enforce sparsity regarding the basis
coefficients, we use the frequently applied $\ell_2$-norm and, in addition,
$\ell_1$-norm regularization. The found classifying function, which is the
linear combination of basis functions, and its variance can then be analyzed in
terms of the classical ANOVA decomposition of functions. Based on numerical

classification tasks even more challenging. Instead of regressing data naively
and individually to each time series type, we take a latent variable model
approach using a mixtured Gaussian processes with learned spectral kernels.
More specifically, we auto-assign each type of noisy time series data a
signature vector called its motion code. Then, conditioned on each assigned
motion code, we infer a sparse approximation of the corresponding time series
using the concept of the most informative timestamps. Our unmixing
classification approach involves maximizing the likelihood across all the mixed
noisy time series sequences of varying lengths. This stochastic approach allows
us to learn not only within a single type of noisy time series data but also
across many underlying stochastic processes, giving us a way to learn multiple
dynamical models in an integrated and robust manner. The different learned
latent stochastic models allow us to generate specific sub-type forecasting. We
provide several quantitative comparisons demonstrating the performance of our
approach.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14081v1'>2402.14081v1</a></div>

these advances in safety-critical settings. While there is recent work on
formal verification of NN-controlled systems, most existing techniques cannot
handle scenarios with more than one agent. To address this research gap, this
paper presents a backward reachability-based approach for verifying the

Given the dynamics models and trained control policies of each agent, the
proposed algorithm computes relative backprojection sets by solving a series of
Mixed Integer Linear Programs (MILPs) offline for each pair of agents. Our
pair-wise approach is parallelizable and thus scales well with increasing

well aligned with real-world scenarios. Using those results, the agents can
quickly check for collision avoidance online by solving low-dimensional Linear
