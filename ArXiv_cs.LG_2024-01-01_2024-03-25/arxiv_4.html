minimum set of function evaluations. Existing methods often assume a discrete
search space with a finite set of data points for function evaluations and
estimating the level sets. When applied to a continuous search space, these

Back-fitting. However, the convergence rate of Back-fitting in training
additive GPs is still an open problem. By utilizing a technique called Kernel
Packets (KP), we prove that the convergence rate of Back-fitting is no faster
than $(1-\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{n}))^t$, where $n$ and $t$ denote the data size
and the iteration number, respectively. Consequently, Back-fitting requires a
minimum of $\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$ iterations to achieve convergence. Based on

Regression (GPR) to process the residuals subsequent to each Back-fitting

suboptimal even for learning sparse linear problems when the number of examples
is below the "dimension" of the problem. This class includes any gradient
descent trained neural net with a fully-connected input layer (initialized with
a rotationally symmetric distribution). The simplest sparse problem is learning
a single feature out of $d$ features. In that case the classification error or
regression loss grows with $1-k/n$ where $k$ is the number of examples seen.
These lower bounds become vacuous when the number of examples $k$ reaches the
dimension $d$.
  We show that when noise is added to this sparse linear problem, rotation
invariant algorithms are still suboptimal after seeing $d$ or more examples. We
prove this via a lower bound for the Bayes optimal algorithm on a rotationally
symmetrized problem. We then prove much lower upper bounds on the same problem
for simple non-rotation invariant algorithms. Finally we analyze the gradient
flow trajectories of many standard optimization algorithms in some simple cases
and show how they veer toward or away from the sparse targets.
  We believe that our trajectory categorization will be useful in designing
algorithms that can exploit sparse targets and our method for proving lower
bounds will be crucial for analyzing other families of algorithms that admit
different classes of invariances.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02697v1'>2403.02697v1</a></div>

  Here, we contribute to the state-of-the-art of this literature by devising
algorithms with provable guarantees for the maximization of two natural
inter-group criteria, namely the minimum spacing and the minimum spanning tree
spacing. The former is the minimum distance between points in different groups
while the latter captures separability through the cost of the minimum spanning
tree that connects all groups. We obtain results for both the unrestricted
case, in which no constraint on the clusters is imposed, and for the
constrained case where each group is required to have a minimum number of
points. Our constraint is motivated by the fact that the popular Single
Linkage, which optimizes both criteria in the unrestricted case, produces
clusterings with many tiny groups.

mobility users, to guide them towards personalized yet sustainable system
outcomes. Even more so than the typical recommendation system, it is crucial to
minimize regret, because 1) the mobility options directly affect the lives of
the users, and 2) the system sustainability relies on sufficient user
participation. In this study, we consider accelerating user preference learning
by exploiting a low-dimensional latent space that captures the mobility
preferences of users. We introduce a hierarchical contextual bandit framework
named Expert with Clustering (EWC), which integrates clustering techniques and
prediction with expert advice. EWC efficiently utilizes hierarchical user
information and incorporates a novel Loss-guided Distance metric. This metric
is instrumental in generating more representative cluster centroids. In a
recommendation scenario with $N$ users, $T$ rounds per user, and $K$ options,
our algorithm achieves a regret bound of $O(N\sqrt{T\log K} + NT)$. This bound
consists of two parts: the first term is the regret from the Hedge algorithm,
and the second term depends on the average loss from clustering. The algorithm
performs with low regret, especially when a latent hierarchical structure
exists among users. This regret bound underscores the theoretical and
experimental efficacy of EWC, particularly in scenarios that demand rapid
learning and adaptation. Experimental results highlight that EWC can
substantially reduce regret by 27.57% compared to the LinUCB baseline. Our work
offers a data-efficient approach to capturing both individual and collective
behaviors, making it highly applicable to contexts with hierarchical

Following the discovery of segments, delivery of messages to users through

portion of users in a behavior segment find match in a medium, and only a
fraction of those matched actually see the message (exposure). Even high
quality discovery becomes futile when delivery fails. Many sophisticated
algorithms exist for discovering behavioral segments; however, these ignore the
delivery component. The problem is compounded because (i) the discovery is
performed on the behavior data space in firms' data (e.g., user clicks), while

reconstruct the geometry of the underlying space from the sampled graph under
the manifold assumption, i.e., assuming that the underlying space is a low

paper further explores the potential of tangles in data sets as a means for a
formal study of clusters. Real-world data often follow a normal distribution.
Accounting for this, we develop a quantitative theory of tangles in data sets

efficient learning. It has gained traction in deep learning, particularly with
the surge in training dataset sizes. Sample selection hinges on two main
aspects: a sample's representation in enhancing performance and the role of
sample diversity in averting overfitting. Existing methods typically measure
both the representation and diversity of data based on similarity metrics, such
as L2-norm. They have capably tackled representation via distribution matching
guided by the similarities of features, gradients, or other information between
data. However, the results of effectively diverse sample selection are mired in
sub-optimality. This is because the similarity metrics usually simply aggregate
dimension similarities without acknowledging disparities among the dimensions
that significantly contribute to the final similarity. As a result, they fall
short of adequately capturing diversity. To address this, we propose a
feature-based diversity constraint, compelling the chosen subset to exhibit
maximum diversity. Our key lies in the introduction of a novel Contributing
Dimension Structure (CDS) metric. Different from similarity metrics that
measure the overall similarity of high-dimensional features, our CDS metric
considers not only the reduction of redundancy in feature dimensions, but also
the difference between dimensions that contribute significantly to the final
similarity. We reveal that existing methods tend to favor samples with similar
CDS, leading to a reduced variety of CDS types within the coreset and
subsequently hindering model performance. In response, we enhance the
performance of five classical selection methods by integrating the CDS
constraint. Our experiments on three datasets demonstrate the general

In this paper, we introduce Hyperdimensional Efficient Active Learning (HEAL),
a novel Active Learning (AL) framework tailored for HDC classification. HEAL
proactively annotates unlabeled data points via uncertainty and
diversity-guided acquisition, leading to a more efficient dataset annotation
and lowering labor costs. Unlike conventional AL methods that only support
classifiers built upon deep neural networks (DNN), HEAL operates without the

design of HEAL is a novel approach for uncertainty estimation in HDC
classifiers through a lightweight HDC ensemble with prior hypervectors.
Additionally, by exploiting hypervectors as prototypes (i.e., compact

within each batch for annotation. Our evaluation shows that HEAL surpasses a

nonsingleton microclusters by their anomaly scores? How to obtain scores that

outliers indicate coalition or repetition in fraud activities, etc.; their
identification is thus highly desirable. This paper presents McCatch: a new
algorithm that detects microclusters by leveraging our proposed 'Oracle' plot

datasets with up to 1M data elements to show that McCatch is the only method
that answers both of the questions above; and, it outperforms 11 other methods,
especially when the data has nonsingleton microclusters or is nondimensional.
We also showcase McCatch's ability to detect meaningful microclusters in

the efficiency and performance of anomaly detection algorithms are challenged
by the large-scale, high-dimensional, and heterogeneous data that are prevalent
in the era of big data. Isolation-based unsupervised anomaly detection is a
novel and effective approach for identifying anomalies in data. It relies on
the idea that anomalies are few and different from normal instances, and thus
can be easily isolated by random partitioning. Isolation-based methods have
several advantages over existing methods, such as low computational complexity,
low memory usage, high scalability, robustness to noise and irrelevant
features, and no need for prior knowledge or heavy parameter tuning. In this
survey, we review the state-of-the-art isolation-based anomaly detection
methods, including their data partitioning strategies, anomaly score functions,
and algorithmic details. We also discuss some extensions and applications of
isolation-based methods in different scenarios, such as detecting anomalies in
streaming data, time series, trajectory, and image datasets. Finally, we

in streamed data. While our initial examples focus on detecting radio-frequency
interference (RFI) in digitized signals within the field of radio astronomy, it
is important to note that SigNova's applicability extends to any type of
streamed data. The framework comprises three primary components. Firstly, we
use the signature transform to extract a canonical collection of summary
statistics from observational sequences. This allows us to represent
variable-length visibility samples as finite-dimensional feature vectors.
Secondly, each feature vector is assigned a novelty score, calculated as the
Mahalanobis distance to its nearest neighbor in an RFI-free training set. By
thresholding these scores we identify observation ranges that deviate from the
expected behavior of RFI-free visibility samples without relying on stringent
distributional assumptions. Thirdly, we integrate this anomaly detector with
Pysegments, a segmentation algorithm, to localize consecutive observations
contaminated with RFI, if any. This approach provides a compelling alternative
to classical windowing techniques commonly used for RFI detection. Importantly,
the complexity of our algorithm depends on the RFI pattern rather than on the
size of the observation window. We demonstrate how SigNova improves the
detection of various types of RFI (e.g., broadband and narrowband) in
time-frequency visibility data. We validate our framework on the Murchison
Widefield Array (MWA) telescope and simulated data and the Hydrogen Epoch of

transients in the era of large-scale astronomical surveys. Modern survey
telescopes are generating tens of thousands of alerts per night, and future
telescopes, such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, are projected to increase
this number dramatically. Currently, most anomaly detection algorithms for
astronomical transients rely either on hand-crafted features extracted from
light curves or on features generated through unsupervised representation
learning, which are then coupled with standard machine learning anomaly
detection algorithms. In this work, we introduce an alternative approach to
detecting anomalies: using the penultimate layer of a neural network classifier
as the latent space for anomaly detection. We then propose a novel method,
named Multi-Class Isolation Forests (MCIF), which trains separate isolation
forests for each class to derive an anomaly score for a light curve from the
latent space representation given by the classifier. This approach
significantly outperforms a standard isolation forest. We also use a simpler
input method for real-time transient classifiers which circumvents the need for
interpolation in light curves and helps the neural network model inter-passband
relationships and handle irregular sampling. Our anomaly detection pipeline
identifies rare classes including kilonovae, pair-instability supernovae, and
intermediate luminosity transients shortly after trigger on simulated Zwicky
Transient Facility light curves. Using a sample of our simulations that matched
the population of anomalies expected in nature (54 anomalies and 12,040 common
transients), our method was able to discover $41\pm3$ anomalies (~75% recall)
after following up the top 2000 (~15%) ranked transients. Our novel method
shows that classifiers can be effectively repurposed for real-time anomaly
detection.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14742v1'>2403.14742v1</a></div>

positioning accuracy in the range of 10 to 40 meters. To increase the accuracy
and reduce the uncertainty of weak signal detection as well as to directly
obtain the position information, we exploit the machine-learning model of
random forests that combines the output of multiple decision trees to give
optimal values of the physical quantities of interest. In particular, from
time-series data gathered from the cockpit of a flying airplane during various
maneuvering stages, where strong background complex signals are caused by other

observation data presents great temporal coverage, the number of stations is
very limited and they are usually built in more populated areas.
  The main objective of this work is to create models capable of inferring
pollutant concentrations in locations where no observation data exists. A
machine learning model, more specifically the random forest model, was
developed for predicting concentrations in the Iberian Peninsula in 2019 for
five selected pollutants: $NO_2$, $O_3$ $SO_2$, $PM10$, and $PM2.5$. Model
features include satellite measurements, meteorological variables, land use
classification, temporal variables (month, day of year), and spatial variables
(latitude, longitude, altitude).
  The models were evaluated using various methods, including station 10-fold
cross-validation, in which in each fold observations from 10\% of the stations
are used as testing data and the rest as training data. The $R^2$, RMSE and
mean bias were determined for each model. The $NO_2$ and $O_3$ models presented
good values of $R^2$, 0.5524 and 0.7462, respectively. However, the $SO_2$,
$PM10$, and $PM2.5$ models performed very poorly in this regard, with $R^2$
values of -0.0231, 0.3722, and 0.3303, respectively. All models slightly
overestimated the ground concentrations, except the $O_3$ model. All models
presented acceptable cross-validation RMSE, except the $O_3$ and $PM10$ models

increasingly valuable for understanding detailed patterns in freight logistics.
In this study, we used the 2017 Commodity Flow Survey Public Use File data set
to explore building a high-performance freight mode choice model, considering
three main improvements: (1) constructing local models for each separate
commodity/industry category; (2) extracting useful geographical features,
particularly the derived distance of each freight mode between
origin/destination zones; and (3) applying additional ensemble learning methods
such as stacking or voting to combine results from local and unified models for
improved performance. The proposed method achieved over 92% accuracy without
incorporating external information, an over 19% increase compared to directly
fitting Random Forests models over 10,000 samples. Furthermore, SHAP (Shapely
Additive Explanations) values were computed to explain the outputs and major
patterns obtained from the proposed model. The model framework could enhance
the performance and interpretability of existing freight mode choice models.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00654v2'>2402.00654v2</a></div>

transportation planning. While statistical learning techniques like discrete
choice models have been used traditionally, machine learning (ML) models have
gained traction recently among the transportation planners due to their higher
predictive performance. However, the black box nature of ML models pose
significant interpretability challenges, limiting their practical application
in decision and policy making. This study utilised a dataset of $1350$
households belonging to low and low-middle income bracket in the city of
Bengaluru to investigate mode choice decision making behaviour using
Multinomial logit model and ML classifiers like decision trees, random forests,
extreme gradient boosting and support vector machines. In terms of accuracy,
random forest model performed the best ($0.788$ on training data and $0.605$ on
testing data) compared to all the other models. This research has adopted
modern interpretability techniques like feature importance and individual
conditional expectation plots to explain the decision making behaviour using ML
models. A higher travel costs significantly reduce the predicted probability of
bus usage compared to other modes (a $0.66\%$ and $0.34\%$ reduction using
Random Forests and XGBoost model for $10\%$ increase in travel cost). However,
reducing travel time by $10\%$ increases the preference for the metro ($0.16\%$
in Random Forests and 0.42% in XGBoost). This research augments the ongoing
research on mode choice analysis using machine learning techniques, which would
help in improving the understanding of the performance of these models with
real-world data in terms of both accuracy and interpretability.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13977v1'>2401.13977v1</a></div>

two key elements of the signature transform: one being its universal
nonlinearity property, which linearizes the feature space and hence translates
the forecasting problem into linear regression, and the other being the
signature kernel, which allows for comparing computationally efficiently
similarities between time series data. Combined, it allows for efficient
feature generation and precise identification of seasonality and regime

  An algorithm based on our technique has been deployed by Amazon trucking

get the data has been based on previous research work, which resulted in a very
interesting discovery. However, the aforementioned study only worked on
individual correlations of the variables with respect to the error. This
research work is going to re-use the main ideas but introduce three main
novelties: (1) applying a data science approach by a few representative
locations; (2) taking advantage of the rankings created by Spearman correlation
but enriching them with other metrics looking for a more robust ranking of the
variables; (3) evaluation of the methodology by learning random forest models
for regression with the distinct experimental variations. The main contribution
is the framework that shows how to convert correlations into rankings and
combine them into an aggregate ranking. We have carried out experiments on five
chosen locations to analyze the behavior of this ranking-based methodology. The
results show that the specific performance is dependent on the location and
season, which is expected, and that this selection technique works properly
with Random Forest models but can also improve simpler regression models such
as Bayesian Ridge. This work also contributes with an extensive analysis of the

predictions made by statistical or physical methods is essential for the
credibility of scientific conclusions. Unfortunately, classical approaches for
validation fail to handle mismatch between locations available for validation
and (test) locations where we want to make predictions. This mismatch is often
not an instance of covariate shift (as commonly formalized) because the
validation and test locations are fixed (e.g., on a grid or at select points)
rather than i.i.d. from two distributions. In the present work, we formalize a
check on validation methods: that they become arbitrarily accurate as
validation data becomes arbitrarily dense. We show that classical and
covariate-shift methods can fail this check. We instead propose a method that
builds from existing ideas in the covariate-shift literature, but adapts them
to the validation data at hand. We prove that our proposal passes our check.

historical socio-economic patterns, raising concerns about a resurgence of
biases and exclusionary practices, with their disproportionate impacts on
society. Addressing this, our paper emphasizes the crucial need to identify and
rectify such biases and calibration errors in predictive models, particularly
as algorithms become more intricate and less interpretable. The increasing
granularity of geospatial information further introduces ethical concerns, as
choosing different geographical scales may exacerbate disparities akin to
redlining and exclusionary zoning. To address these issues, we propose a
toolkit for identifying and mitigating biases arising from geospatial data.
Extending classical fairness definitions, we incorporate an ordinal regression
case with spatial attributes, deviating from the binary classification focus.
This extension allows us to gauge disparities stemming from data aggregation

datasets (as is done by various companies including Safegraph, Google, and
Facebook), while ignoring the bias, leads to an inaccurate representation of

consequences, as these datasets are used for sensitive decision-making such as

systems with negative consequences for downstream applications, particularly
when employed for decision-making. Conformal prediction provides a
model-agnostic framework for uncertainty quantification that can be applied to
any dataset, irrespective of its distribution, post hoc. In contrast to other
pixel-level uncertainty quantification methods, conformal prediction operates
without requiring access to the underlying model and training dataset,
concurrently offering statistically valid and informative prediction regions,
all while maintaining computational efficiency. In response to the increased
need to report uncertainty alongside point predictions, we bring attention to
the promise of conformal prediction within the domain of Earth Observation (EO)
applications. To accomplish this, we assess the current state of uncertainty
quantification in the EO domain and found that only 20% of the reviewed Google
Earth Engine (GEE) datasets incorporated a degree of uncertainty information,
with unreliable methods prevalent. Next, we introduce modules that seamlessly
integrate into existing GEE predictive modelling workflows and demonstrate the
application of these tools for datasets spanning local to global scales,
including the Dynamic World and Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI)
datasets. These case studies encompass regression and classification tasks,
featuring both traditional and deep learning-based workflows. Subsequently, we
discuss the opportunities arising from the use of conformal prediction in EO.
We anticipate that the increased availability of easy-to-use implementations of
conformal predictors, such as those provided here, will drive wider adoption of
rigorous uncertainty quantification in EO, thereby enhancing the reliability of
uses such as operational monitoring and decision making.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06421v1'>2401.06421v1</a></div>

Additionally, we incorporate feature scaling through standardization to render

confidence intervals. Unfortunately, neither parametric nor non-parametric
tests solve the inherent problems around partitioning small sample-size
datasets and learning from heterogeneous data sources. The fact that machine
learning strongly depends on the learning parameters and the distribution of
data across folds recapitulates familiar difficulties around excess false
positives and replication. The origins of this problem are demonstrated by
simulating common experimental circumstances, including small sample sizes, low
numbers of predictors, and heterogeneous data sources. A novel statistical test
based on K-fold CV and the Upper Bound of the actual error (K-fold CUBV) is
composed, where uncertain predictions of machine learning with CV are bounded
by the \emph{worst case} through the evaluation of concentration inequalities.
Probably Approximately Correct-Bayesian upper bounds for linear classifiers in
combination with K-fold CV is used to estimate the empirical error. The
performance with neuroimaging datasets suggests this is a robust criterion for
detecting effects, validating accuracy values obtained from machine learning
whilst avoiding excess false positives.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16407v1'>2401.16407v1</a></div>

that the theoretical upper bound of binary classification performance on actual

Committee Machine (BCM) potential, specifically designed to predict
oxygen-containing organic compounds within eight groups of CHO. The BCM

the model-X knockoff method or the T-Rex selector. To address this issue, we

products and services that meet their needs. As a key contributing factor to
economic growth and investment opportunity, financial inclusion increases
consumer spending and consequently business development. It has been shown that
institutions are more profitable when they provide marginalised social groups
access to financial services. Customer segmentation based on consumer
transaction data is a well-known strategy used to promote financial inclusion.
While the required data is available to modern institutions, the challenge
remains that segment annotations are usually difficult and/or expensive to
obtain. This prevents the usage of time series classification models for
customer segmentation based on domain expert knowledge. As a result, clustering
is an attractive alternative to partition customers into homogeneous groups
based on the spending behaviour encoded within their transaction data. In this
paper, we present a solution to one of the key challenges preventing modern
financial institutions from providing financially inclusive credit, savings and
insurance products: the inability to understand consumer financial behaviour,
and hence risk, without the introduction of restrictive conventional credit
scoring techniques. We present a novel time series clustering algorithm that
allows institutions to understand the financial behaviour of their customers.
This enables unique product offerings to be provided based on the needs of the

learning and statistics -- how well does an algorithm perform at a given
modeling task, and which algorithm performs best? Many methods have been
developed to assess algorithm performance, often based around cross-validation
type strategies, retraining the algorithm of interest on different subsets of
the data and assessing its performance on the held-out data points. Despite the
broad use of such procedures, the theoretical properties of these methods are
not yet fully understood. In this work, we explore some fundamental limits for
answering these questions with limited amounts of data. In particular, we make
a distinction between two questions: how good is an algorithm $A$ at the
problem of learning from a training set of size $n$, versus, how good is a
particular fitted model produced by running $A$ on a particular training data
set of size $n$?
  Our main results prove that, for any test that treats the algorithm $A$ as a
``black box'' (i.e., we can only study the behavior of $A$ empirically), there
is a fundamental limit on our ability to carry out inference on the performance
of $A$, unless the number of available data points $N$ is many times larger
than the sample size $n$ of interest. (On the other hand, evaluating the
performance of a particular fitted model is easy as long as a holdout data set
is available -- that is, as long as $N-n$ is not too small.) We also ask
whether an assumption of algorithmic stability might be sufficient to
circumvent this hardness result. Surprisingly, we find that this is not the
case: the same hardness result still holds for the problem of evaluating the
performance of $A$, aside from a high-stability regime where fitted models are
essentially nonrandom. Finally, we also establish similar hardness results for
the problem of comparing multiple algorithms.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07388v2'>2402.07388v2</a></div>

an excessively high accuracy gap for early halt times, our main contribution is
the proposal of a framework that controls a stronger notion of error, where the

has emerged as a desirable and widely-studied statistical property of the
outputs of binary prediction models. However, the algorithmic aspects of
measuring model calibration have remained relatively less well-explored.
Motivated by [BGHN23], which proposed a rigorous framework for measuring
distances to calibration, we initiate the algorithmic study of calibration
through the lens of property testing. We define the problem of calibration
testing from samples where given $n$ draws from a distribution $\mathcal{D}$ on
(predictions, binary outcomes), our goal is to distinguish between the case
where $\mathcal{D}$ is perfectly calibrated, and the case where $\mathcal{D}$
is $\varepsilon$-far from calibration.
  We design an algorithm based on approximate linear programming, which solves
calibration testing information-theoretically optimally (up to constant
factors) in time $O(n^{1.5} \log(n))$. This improves upon state-of-the-art
black-box linear program solvers requiring $\Omega(n^\omega)$ time, where
$\omega &gt; 2$ is the exponent of matrix multiplication. We also develop
algorithms for tolerant variants of our testing problem, and give sample
complexity lower bounds for alternative calibration distances to the one
considered in this work. Finally, we present preliminary experiments showing
that the testing problem we define faithfully captures standard notions of
calibration, and that our algorithms scale to accommodate moderate sample

predict labels $\mathbf y$ given points $\mathbf x$ from a distribution. An
\textit{omnipredictor} for a class $\mathcal L$ of loss functions and a class
$\mathcal C$ of hypotheses is a predictor whose predictions incur less expected
loss than the best hypothesis in $\mathcal C$ for every loss in $\mathcal L$.
Since the work of [GKR+21] that introduced the notion, there has been a large
body of work in the setting of binary labels where $\mathbf y \in \{0, 1\}$,
but much less is known about the regression setting where $\mathbf y \in [0,1]$
can be continuous. Our main conceptual contribution is the notion of
\textit{sufficient statistics} for loss minimization over a family of loss
functions: these are a set of statistics about a distribution such that knowing
them allows one to take actions that minimize the expected loss for any loss in
the family. The notion of sufficient statistics relates directly to the
approximate rank of the family of loss functions.
  Our key technical contribution is a bound of $O(1/\varepsilon^{2/3})$ on the
$\epsilon$-approximate rank of convex, Lipschitz functions on the interval
$[0,1]$, which we show is tight up to a factor of $\mathrm{polylog}
(1/\epsilon)$. This yields improved runtimes for learning omnipredictors for
the class of all convex, Lipschitz loss functions under weak learnability
assumptions about the class $\mathcal C$. We also give efficient omnipredictors
when the loss families have low-degree polynomial approximations, or arise from
generalized linear models (GLMs). This translation from sufficient statistics
to faster omnipredictors is made possible by lifting the technique of loss
outcome indistinguishability introduced by [GKH+23] for Boolean labels to the
regression setting.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14645v1'>2401.14645v1</a></div>

to the problem lies in the overlap of feature spaces between majority and

Our approach is to synthesize the findings of L1 and L2 regularization. For our

to the existence of two problematic classes that are hard to separate. We
report first with the exclusion of one of them and then with its inclusion. We

regression with L1 (LR+L1) against that with L2 (LR+L2) by varying the sizes of

difference in accuracy between the two methods once the feature set is
selected. We chose a synthesis, i.e., only those features that were present in
both the sets obtained from L1 and that from L2, and experimented with it on
more complex models like Decision Tree and Random Forest and observed that the

project anchor graph into the label space through an orthogonal projection

when projected in different views separately, we extend the matrix projection
transformation to tensor projection, so that the spatial structure information

Typically, the naive approach for obtaining LSH for tensor data involves first
reshaping the tensor into vectors, followed by applying existing LSH methods
for vector data $E2LSH$ and $SRP$. However, this approach becomes impractical
for higher order tensors because the size of the reshaped vector becomes
exponential in the order of the tensor. Consequently, the size of LSH

support for vector databases is increasingly desirable. This hinges on an
efficient filtered search operation, i.e., only querying the vectors accessible
to a particular tenant. Multi-tenancy in vector databases is currently achieved
by building either a single, shared index among all tenants, or a per-tenant
index. The former optimizes for memory efficiency at the expense of search
performance, while the latter does the opposite. Instead, this paper presents
Curator, an in-memory vector index design tailored for multi-tenant queries
that simultaneously achieves the two conflicting goals, low memory overhead and
high performance for queries, vector insertion, and deletion. Curator indexes
each tenant's vectors with a tenant-specific clustering tree and encodes these
trees compactly as sub-trees of a shared clustering tree. Each tenant's
clustering tree adapts dynamically to its unique vector distribution, while
maintaining a low per-tenant memory footprint. Our evaluation, based on two

large-scale data. However, these methods typically entail two distinct stages:
selecting anchor points and constructing an anchor graph. This bifurcation,
along with the initialization of anchor points, significantly influences the
overall performance of the algorithm. To mitigate these issues, we introduce a
novel method termed Anchor-free Clustering based on Anchor Graph Factorization
(AFCAGF). AFCAGF innovates in learning the anchor graph, requiring only the
computation of pairwise distances between samples. This process, achievable
through straightforward optimization, circumvents the necessity for explicit
selection of anchor points. More concretely, our approach enhances the Fuzzy
k-means clustering algorithm (FKM), introducing a new manifold learning
technique that obviates the need for initializing cluster centers.
Additionally, we evolve the concept of the membership matrix between cluster
centers and samples in FKM into an anchor graph encompassing multiple anchor
points and samples. Employing Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) on this
anchor graph allows for the direct derivation of cluster labels, thereby
eliminating the requirement for further post-processing steps. To solve the

this article, we focus on knowledge transfer for unsupervised learning tasks in
contrast to the supervised learning tasks in the literature. Given the
transferable source populations, we propose a two-step transfer learning
algorithm to extract useful information from multiple source principal
component analysis (PCA) studies, thereby enhancing estimation accuracy for the
target PCA task. In the first step, we integrate the shared subspace
information across multiple studies by a proposed method named as Grassmannian
barycenter, instead of directly performing PCA on the pooled dataset. The
proposed Grassmannian barycenter method enjoys robustness and computational
advantages in more general cases. Then the resulting estimator for the shared
subspace from the first step is further utilized to estimate the target private
subspace in the second step. Our theoretical analysis credits the gain of
knowledge transfer between PCA studies to the enlarged eigenvalue gap, which is
different from the existing supervised transfer learning tasks where sparsity
plays the central role. In addition, we prove that the bilinear forms of the
empirical spectral projectors have asymptotic normality under weaker eigenvalue
gap conditions after knowledge transfer. When the set of informativesources is
unknown, we endow our algorithm with the capability of useful dataset selection
by solving a rectified optimization problem on the Grassmann manifold, which in
turn leads to a computationally friendly rectified Grassmannian K-means
procedure. In the end, extensive numerical simulation results and a real data

the conflictive data instances by removing them or replacing conflictive views.
Nevertheless, real-world applications usually require making decisions for

point out a new Reliable Conflictive Multi-view Learning (RCML) problem, which
requires the model to provide decision results and attached reliabilities for

results in the fuzzy information contained in the rules being ignored. To do
so, this paper employs iterative feature selection in fuzzy rule-based binary
classification. The proposed algorithm combines feature selection based on
fuzzy correlation family with rule mining based on biclustering. It first
conducts biclustering on the dataset after feature selection. Then it conducts
feature selection again for the biclusters according to the feedback of
biclusters evaluation. In this way, an iterative feature selection framework is
build. During the iteration process, it stops until the obtained bicluster
meets the requirements. In addition, the rule membership function is introduced
to extract vectorized fuzzy rules from the bicluster and construct weak
classifiers. The weak classifiers with good classification performance are
selected by Adaptive Boosting and the strong classifier is constructed by

that benefits from the low number of parameters and fast convergence. A hybrid
method can simultaneously benefit from the advantages of TLBO and tackle the
possible entrapment in the local optimum. By proposing a hybrid of TLBO, Grey
Wolf Optimizer (GWO), and Genetic Algorithm (GA) operators, this paper suggests
a filter-based FS algorithm (TLBO-GWO). Six benchmark datasets are selected,
and TLBO-GWO is compared with three recently proposed FS algorithms with
similar approaches, the main TLBO and GWO. The comparison is conducted based on
clustering evaluation measures, convergence behavior, and dimension reduction,
and is validated using statistical tests. The results reveal that TLBO-GWO can
significantly enhance the effectiveness of the text clustering technique
(K-means).</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11839v1'>2402.11839v1</a></div>

groups. Text documents must be prepared and represented in a way that is
appropriate for the algorithms used for data mining prior to classification. As
a result, a number of term weighting strategies have been created in the

compares the effects of Binary and Term frequency weighting feature
methodologies on the text's classification method when stop words are
eliminated once and when they are not. In recognition of assessing the effects
of prior weighting of features approaches on classification results in terms of
accuracy, recall, precision, and F-measure values, we used an Arabic data set
made up of 322 documents divided into six main topics (agriculture, economy,
health, politics, science, and sport), each of which contains 50 documents,
with the exception of the health category, which contains 61 documents. The
results demonstrate that for all metrics, the term frequency feature weighting
approach with stop word removal outperforms the binary approach, while for
accuracy, recall, and F-Measure, the binary approach outperforms the TF
approach without stop word removal. However, for precision, the two approaches
produce results that are very similar. Additionally, it is clear from the data
that, using the same phrase weighting approach, stop word removing increases

certain probability. Recently, other more sophisticated ensemble strategies,
such as the Caruana method or the stacking strategy has been proposed. On the
one hand, the Caruana method performs well in HPO ensemble, since it is not
affected by the effects of multicollinearity, which is prevalent in HPO. It
just computes the average over a subset of predictions with replacement. But it
does not benefit from the generalization power of a learning process. On the

meta-learner is adequate. Besides, some meta-learners may suffer from the
effects of multicollinearity or need to be tuned to reduce them. This paper
explores meta-learners for stacking ensemble in HPO, free of hyperparameter

ensemble learning process generalization power. At this respect, the boosting
strategy seems promising as a stacking meta-learner. In fact, it completely
removes the effects of multicollinearity. This paper also proposes an implicit

which are then used to define value thresholds. Then classifiers are trained to
predict whether the value to be regressed is less than or equal to each of
these thresholds. The different outputs of the classifiers are then
concatenated in the form of an additional vector of variables that enriches the

Classification, since it identifies the relevant variables, making thus the
classification procedures more interpretable, cheaper in terms of measurement
and more effective by reducing noise and data overfit. The relevance of
features in a classification procedure is linked to the fact that
misclassifications costs are frequently asymmetric, since false positive and
false negative cases may have very different consequences. However,
off-the-shelf Feature Selection procedures seldom take into account such
cost-sensitivity of errors.
  In this paper we propose a mathematical-optimization-based Feature Selection
procedure embedded in one of the most popular classification procedures,
namely, Support Vector Machines, accommodating asymmetric misclassification
costs. The key idea is to replace the traditional margin maximization by
minimizing the number of features selected, but imposing upper bounds on the
false positive and negative rates. The problem is written as an integer linear
problem plus a quadratic convex problem for Support Vector Machines with both
linear and radial kernels.
  The reported numerical experience demonstrates the usefulness of the proposed
Feature Selection procedure. Indeed, our results on benchmark data sets show
that a substantial decrease of the number of features is obtained, whilst the

useful for data streams. The `river` package is a Python OML-library, which

assumption that the data follows the same distribution in both the training and
the test datasets. However, in real world data this condition does not hold
and, for instance, the distribution of the covariates changes whereas the
conditional distribution of the targets remains unchanged. This situation is
called covariate shift problem where standard error estimation may be no longer
accurate. In this context, the importance is a measure commonly used to
alleviate the influence of covariate shift on error estimations. The main
drawback is that it is not easy to compute. The Kullback-Leibler Importance
Estimation Procedure (KLIEP) is capable of estimating importance in a promising
way. Despite its good performance, it fails to ignore target information, since
it only includes the covariates information for computing the importance. In
this direction, this paper explores the potential performance improvement if
target information is considered in the computation of the importance. Then, a
redefinition of the importance arises in order to be generalized in this way.
Besides the potential improvement in performance, including target information
make possible the application to a real application about plankton
classification that motivates this research and characterized by its great
dimensionality, since considering targets rather than covariates reduces the
computation and the noise in the covariates. The impact of taking target
information is also explored when Logistic Regression (LR), Kernel Mean
Matching (KMM), Ensemble Kernel Mean Matching (EKMM) and the naive predecessor
of KLIEP called Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) methods estimate the
importance. The experimental results lead to a more accurate error estimation

large VC dimension, hence do not generalize well. We show that watershed
classifiers can find arbitrary boundaries on any dense enough dataset, and, at
the same time, have very small VC dimension; hence a watershed classifier leads
to good generalization.
  Traditional approaches to regularize 1NN classifiers are to consider $K$

past two decades owing to its wide range of applications across various fields.
Despite its versatility, SVR encounters challenges when confronted with
outliers and noise, primarily due to the use of the $\varepsilon$-insensitive
loss function. To address this limitation, SVR with bounded loss functions has
emerged as an appealing alternative, offering enhanced generalization
performance and robustness. Notably, recent developments focus on designing
bounded loss functions with smooth characteristics, facilitating the adoption
of gradient-based optimization algorithms. However, it's crucial to highlight
that these bounded and smooth loss functions do not possess an insensitive
zone. In this paper, we address the aforementioned constraints by introducing a
novel symmetric loss function named the HawkEye loss function. It is worth
noting that the HawkEye loss function stands out as the first loss function in
SVR literature to be bounded, smooth, and simultaneously possess an insensitive
zone. Leveraging this breakthrough, we integrate the HawkEye loss function into
the least squares framework of SVR and yield a new fast and robust model termed
HE-LSSVR. The optimization problem inherent to HE-LSSVR is addressed by
harnessing the adaptive moment estimation (Adam) algorithm, known for its
adaptive learning rate and efficacy in handling large-scale problems. To our
knowledge, this is the first time Adam has been employed to solve an SVR
problem. To empirically validate the proposed HE-LSSVR model, we evaluate it on
UCI, synthetic, and time series datasets. The experimental outcomes
unequivocally reveal the superiority of the HE-LSSVR model both in terms of its
remarkable generalization performance and its efficiency in training time.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16785v2'>2401.16785v2</a></div>

In the
search for white box models - as opposed to black box models, like random
forests or neural networks - rule induction algorithms are a logical and
promising option, since the rules can easily be understood by humans. Fuzzy and
rough set theory have been successfully applied to this archetype, almost
always separately. As both approaches to rule induction involve granular
computing based on the concept of equivalence classes, it is natural to combine
them. The QuickRules\cite{JensenCornelis2009} algorithm was a first attempt at
using fuzzy rough set theory for rule induction. It is based on QuickReduct, a
greedy algorithm for building decision reducts. QuickRules already showed an
improvement over other rule induction methods. However, to evaluate the full
potential of a fuzzy rough rule induction algorithm, one needs to start from
the foundations. In this paper, we introduce a novel rule induction algorithm
called Fuzzy Rough Rule Induction (FRRI). We provide background and explain the
workings of our algorithm. Furthermore, we perform a computational experiment
to evaluate the performance of our algorithm and compare it to other
state-of-the-art rule induction approaches. We find that our algorithm is more
accurate while creating small rulesets consisting of relatively short rules. We
end the paper by outlining some directions for future work.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04447v1'>2403.04447v1</a></div>

models built by three AutoML packages: auto-sklearn, AutoGluon, and FLAML. The
given ensemble is analyzed from different perspectives. We conduct a predictive
performance investigation through evaluation metrics of the ensemble and its

this topic. We use this perspective to show that, when studied as smoothers,
randomized tree ensembles not only make predictions that are quantifiably more
smooth than the predictions of the individual trees they consist of, but also
further regulate their smoothness at test-time based on the dissimilarity
between testing and training inputs. First, we use this insight to revisit,
refine and reconcile two recent explanations of forest success by providing a
new way of quantifying the conjectured behaviors of tree ensembles objectively
by measuring the effective degree of smoothing they imply. Then, we move beyond
existing explanations for the mechanisms by which tree ensembles improve upon
individual trees and challenge the popular wisdom that the superior performance
of forests should be understood as a consequence of variance reduction alone.
We argue that the current high-level dichotomy into bias- and
variance-reduction prevalent in statistics is insufficient to understand tree
ensembles -- because the prevailing definition of bias does not capture
differences in the expressivity of the hypothesis classes formed by trees and
forests. Instead, we show that forests can improve upon trees by three distinct
mechanisms that are usually implicitly entangled. In particular, we demonstrate
that the smoothing effect of ensembling can reduce variance in predictions due
to noise in outcome generation, reduce variability in the quality of the

non-adaptive regions. New conformal scores, often relying upon quantile
regressors or conditional density estimators, aim to address this limitation.
Although they are useful for creating prediction bands, these scores are
detached from the original goal of quantifying the uncertainty around an
arbitrary predictive model. This paper presents a new, model-agnostic family of

Initially proposed seven decades ago, approaches to selective regression have

Conformal prediction (CP) handles uncertainty by predicting a set on a test
input, hoping the set to cover the true label with at least $(1-\alpha)$
confidence. This coverage can be guaranteed on test data even if the marginal
distributions $P_X$ differ between calibration and test datasets. However, as
it is common in practice, when the conditional distribution $P_{Y|X}$ is
different on calibration and test data, the coverage is not guaranteed and it
is essential to measure and minimize the coverage loss under distributional
shift at \textit{all} possible confidence levels. To address these issues, we
upper bound the coverage difference at all levels using the cumulative density
functions of calibration and test conformal scores and Wasserstein distance.
Inspired by the invariance of physics across data distributions, we propose a

a simulation study. For the case studies, risk estimates were visualised using
heatmaps in a 2-dimensional subspace. The simulation study included 48 logistic
data generating mechanisms (DGM), varying the predictor distribution, the
number of predictors, the correlation between predictors, the true c-statistic
and the strength of true predictors. For each DGM, 1000 training datasets of
size 200 or 4000 were simulated and RF models trained with minimum node size 2
or 20 using ranger package, resulting in 192 scenarios in total. The
visualizations suggested that the model learned spikes of probability around
events in the training set. A cluster of events created a bigger peak, isolated
events local peaks. In the simulation study, median training c-statistics were
between 0.97 and 1 unless there were 4 or 16 binary predictors with minimum
node size 20. Median test c-statistics were higher with higher events per
variable, higher minimum node size, and binary predictors. Median training
slopes were always above 1, and were not correlated with median test slopes
across scenarios (correlation -0.11). Median test slopes were higher with
higher true c-statistic, higher minimum node size, and higher sample size.
Random forests learn local probability peaks that often yield near perfect
training c-statistics without strongly affecting c-statistics on test data.
When the aim is probability estimation, the simulation results go against the
common recommendation to use fully grown trees in random forest models.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18612v1'>2402.18612v1</a></div>

common patient subgroups exist across different ICUs, which would determine
whether ICU restructuring could be operationalised in a standardised manner. In
this paper, we tested the hypothesis that common ICU patient subgroups exist by
examining whether the results from one existing study generalise to a different

consensus clustering to derive patient subgroups, replicating the previous
study. We found limited similarities between our results and those of the

  Results: The experimental results revealed that the meta-model surpasses the

which is a frequently occurring scenario in many real-world applications. Data
resampling is considered to be the standard approach to address this issue. The
goal of the technique is to balance the class distribution by generating new
samples or eliminating samples from the data. A wide variety of sampling
techniques have been proposed over the years to tackle this challenging
problem. Sampling techniques can also be incorporated into the ensemble
learning framework to obtain more generalized prediction performance. Balanced
Random Forest (BRF) and SMOTE-Bagging are some of the popular ensemble
approaches. In this study, we propose a modification to the BRF classifier to
enhance the prediction performance. In the original algorithm, the Random
Undersampling (RUS) technique was utilized to balance the bootstrap samples.
However, randomly eliminating too many samples from the data leads to
significant data loss, resulting in a major decline in performance. We propose
to alleviate the scenario by incorporating a novel hybrid sampling approach to
balance the uneven class distribution in each bootstrap sub-sample. Our
proposed hybrid sampling technique, when incorporated into the framework of the
Random Forest classifier, termed as iBRF: improved Balanced Random Forest
classifier, achieves better prediction performance than other sampling
techniques used in imbalanced classification tasks. Experiments were carried
out on 44 imbalanced datasets on which the original BRF classifier produced an
average MCC score of 47.03% and an F1 score of 49.09%. Our proposed algorithm
outperformed the approach by producing a far better MCC score of 53.04% and an

classes: Each class may have unique attributes, such as sample size, label
quality, or predictability (easy vs difficult), and variable importance at
test-time. Without care, these heterogeneities impede the learning process,
most notably, when optimizing fairness objectives. Confirming this, under a
gaussian mixture setting, we show that the optimal SVM classifier for balanced
accuracy needs to be adaptive to the class attributes. This motivates us to
propose CAP: An effective and general method that generates a class-specific
learning strategy (e.g. hyperparameter) based on the attributes of that class.
This way, optimization process better adapts to heterogeneities. CAP leads to
substantial improvements over the naive approach of assigning separate
hyperparameters to each class. We instantiate CAP for loss function design and
post-hoc logit adjustment, with emphasis on label-imbalanced problems. We show
that CAP is competitive with prior art and its flexibility unlocks clear
benefits for fairness objectives beyond balanced accuracy. Finally, we evaluate
CAP on problems with label noise as well as weighted test objectives to
showcase how CAP can jointly adapt to different heterogeneities.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14343v1'>2401.14343v1</a></div>

from data with noisy labels. Most work on learning from noisy labels has
focused on standard loss-based performance measures. However, many machine
learning problems require using non-decomposable performance measures which
cannot be expressed as the expectation or sum of a loss on individual examples;
these include for example the H-mean, Q-mean and G-mean in class imbalance
settings, and the Micro $F_1$ in information retrieval. In this paper, we
design algorithms to learn from noisy labels for two broad classes of
multiclass non-decomposable performance measures, namely, monotonic convex and
ratio-of-linear, which encompass all the above examples. Our work builds on the
Frank-Wolfe and Bisection based methods of Narasimhan et al. (2015). In both
cases, we develop noise-corrected versions of the algorithms under the widely
studied family of class-conditional noise models. We provide regret (excess
risk) bounds for our algorithms, establishing that even though they are trained
on noisy data, they are Bayes consistent in the sense that their performance
converges to the optimal performance w.r.t. the clean (non-noisy) distribution.
Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms in handling
label noise.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01055v2'>2402.01055v2</a></div>

surrogate loss functions for gradient-based optimisation. The consistency of
surrogate loss functions is not proven and is exacerbated by the conflicting
nature of multi-label loss functions. To directly learn from multiple related,
yet potentially conflicting multi-label loss functions, we propose a Consistent
Lebesgue Measure-based Multi-label Learner (CLML) and prove that CLML can
achieve theoretical consistency under a Bayes risk framework. Empirical
evidence supports our theory by demonstrating that: (1) CLML can consistently
achieve state-of-the-art results; (2) the primary performance factor is the
Lebesgue measure design, as CLML optimises a simpler feedforward model without
additional label graph, perturbation-based conditioning, or semantic
embeddings; and (3) an analysis of the results not only distinguishes CLML's
effectiveness but also highlights inconsistencies between the surrogate and the
desired loss functions.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00324v1'>2402.00324v1</a></div>

into the reals with dimension at least $n-1$ in order to design a consistent
surrogate loss that leads to the "correct" classification, regardless of the
data distribution. For large $n$, such as in information retrieval and
structured prediction tasks, optimizing a surrogate in $n-1$ dimensions is
often intractable. We investigate ways to trade off surrogate loss dimension,
the number of problem instances, and restricting the region of consistency in
the simplex for multiclass classification. Following past work, we examine an
intuitive embedding procedure that maps outcomes into the vertices of convex
polytopes in a low-dimensional surrogate space. We show that full-dimensional
subsets of the simplex exist around each point mass distribution for which
consistency holds, but also, with less than $n-1$ dimensions, there exist
distributions for which a phenomenon called hallucination occurs, which is when
the optimal report under the surrogate loss is an outcome with zero
probability. Looking towards application, we derive a result to check if
consistency holds under a given polytope embedding and low-noise assumption,
providing insight into when to use a particular embedding. We provide examples
of embedding $n = 2^{d}$ outcomes into the $d$-dimensional unit cube and $n =
d!$ outcomes into the $d$-dimensional permutahedron under low-noise
assumptions. Finally, we demonstrate that with multiple problem instances, we
can learn the mode with $\frac{n}{2}$ dimensions over the whole simplex.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10818v1'>2402.10818v1</a></div>

realistic yet challenging task: addressing imbalances in labeled data while the
class distribution of unlabeled data remains both unknown and potentially
mismatched. Current approaches in this sphere often presuppose rigid
assumptions regarding the class distribution of unlabeled data, thereby
limiting the adaptability of models to only certain distribution ranges. In
this study, we propose a novel approach, introducing a highly adaptable
framework, designated as SimPro, which does not rely on any predefined
assumptions about the distribution of unlabeled data. Our framework, grounded
in a probabilistic model, innovatively refines the expectation-maximization
(EM) algorithm by explicitly decoupling the modeling of conditional and
marginal class distributions. This separation facilitates a closed-form
solution for class distribution estimation during the maximization phase,
leading to the formulation of a Bayes classifier. The Bayes classifier, in
turn, enhances the quality of pseudo-labels in the expectation phase.
Remarkably, the SimPro framework not only comes with theoretical guarantees but
also is straightforward to implement. Moreover, we introduce two novel class
distributions broadening the scope of the evaluation. Our method showcases
consistent state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks and data
distribution scenarios. Our code is available at
