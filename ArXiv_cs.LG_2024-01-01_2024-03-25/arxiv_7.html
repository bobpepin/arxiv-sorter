years due to its privacy-preserving features, among other advantages.
Nevertheless, the exchange of model updates and gradients in this architecture
provides new attack surfaces for malicious users of the network which may
jeopardize the model performance and user and data privacy. For this reason,
one of the main motivations for decentralized federated learning is to
eliminate server-related threats by removing the server from the network and
compensating for it through technologies such as blockchain. However, this
advantage comes at the cost of challenging the system with new privacy threats.
Thus, performing a thorough security analysis in this new paradigm is
necessary. This survey studies possible variations of threats and adversaries
in decentralized federated learning and overviews the potential defense
mechanisms. Trustability and verifiability of decentralized federated learning
are also considered in this study.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17319v1'>2401.17319v1</a></div>

However, most current FL systems suffer from data privacy issues due to the
requirement of a trusted third party. Although some previous works introduce
differential privacy to protect the data, however, it may also significantly
deteriorate the model performance. To address these issues, we propose a novel
decentralized collaborative AI framework, named Auditable Homomorphic-based
Decentralised Collaborative AI (AerisAI), to improve security with homomorphic
encryption and fine-grained differential privacy. Our proposed AerisAI directly
aggregates the encrypted parameters with a blockchain-based smart contract to
get rid of the need of a trusted third party. We also propose a brand-new
concept for eliminating the negative impacts of differential privacy for model

group key management based on ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption
(CPABE) to achieve fine-grained access control based on different service-level

training of clients from local gradient updates without exposing raw data.
However, existing secure aggregation schemes inevitably perform an expensive
fresh setup per round because each client needs to establish fresh
input-independent secrets over different rounds. The latest research, Flamingo
(S&amp;P 2023), designed a share-transfer-based reusable secret key to support the
server continuously performing multiple rounds of aggregation. Nevertheless,
the share transfer mechanism it proposed can only be achieved with P
probability, which has limited reliability. To tackle the aforementioned
problems, we propose a more reliable and anonymously authenticated scheme
called Chu-ko-nu for multi-round secure aggregation. Specifically, in terms of
share transfer, Chu-ko-nu breaks the probability P barrier by supplementing a
redistribution process of secret key components (the sum of all components is
the secret key), thus ensuring the reusability of the secret key. Based on this
reusable secret key, Chu-ko-nu can efficiently perform consecutive aggregation
in the following rounds. Furthermore, considering the client identity
authentication and privacy protection issue most approaches ignore, Chu-ko-nu
introduces a zero-knowledge proof-based authentication mechanism. It can
support clients anonymously participating in FL training and enables the server
to authenticate clients effectively in the presence of various attacks.
Rigorous security proofs and extensive experiments demonstrated that Chu-ko-nu
can provide reliable and anonymously authenticated aggregation for FL with low
aggregation costs, at least a 21.02% reduction compared to the state-of-the-art
schemes.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15111v1'>2402.15111v1</a></div>

data distributed on massive clients without exposing data privacy. It works
effectively in the ideal federation where clients share homogeneous data
distribution and learning behavior. However, FL may fail to function
appropriately when the federation is not ideal, amid an unhealthy state called
Negative Federated Learning (NFL), in which most clients gain no benefit from
participating in FL. Many studies have tried to address NFL. However, their
solutions either (1) predetermine to prevent NFL in the entire learning
life-cycle or (2) tackle NFL in the aftermath of numerous learning rounds.
Thus, they either (1) indiscriminately incur extra costs even if FL can perform
well without such costs or (2) waste numerous learning rounds. Additionally,
none of the previous work takes into account the clients who may be
unwilling/unable to follow the proposed NFL solutions when using those
solutions to upgrade an FL system in use. This paper introduces FL-GUARD, a
holistic framework that can be employed on any FL system for tackling NFL in a
run-time paradigm. That is, to dynamically detect NFL at the early stage (tens
of rounds) of learning and then to activate recovery measures when necessary.
Specifically, we devise a cost-effective NFL detection mechanism, which relies
on an estimation of performance gain on clients. Only when NFL is detected, we
activate the NFL recovery process, in which each client learns in parallel an
adapted model when training the global model. Extensive experiment results
confirm the effectiveness of FL-GUARD in detecting NFL and recovering from NFL
to a healthy learning state. We also show that FL-GUARD is compatible with
previous NFL solutions and robust against clients unwilling/unable to take any
recovery measures.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04146v1'>2403.04146v1</a></div>

model across multiple insurance industry datasets without requiring the
datasets themselves to be shared from one company to another. The application
of FL addresses two of the most pressing concerns: limited data volume and data
variety, which are caused by privacy concerns, the rarity of claim events, the
lack of informative rating factors, etc.. During each round of FL,
collaborators compute improvements on the model using their local private data,
and these insights are combined to update a global model. Such aggregation of
insights allows for an increase to the effectiveness in forecasting claims
losses compared to models individually trained at each collaborator.
Critically, this approach enables machine learning collaboration without the
need for raw data to leave the compute infrastructure of each respective data
owner. Additionally, the open-source framework, OpenFL, that is used in our
experiments is designed so that it can be run using confidential computing as
well as with additional algorithmic protections against leakage of information
via the shared model updates. In such a way, FL is implemented as a
privacy-enhancing collaborative learning technique that addresses the
challenges posed by the sensitivity and privacy of data in traditional machine

Hence, it is hard but crucial to allow multiple parties to collaboratively

without the need for direct sharing of those datasets or compromising the
privacy of the datasets through collaboration. In this paper, we address this

allows different parties to collaboratively train an ML model without
transferring their private datasets; (2) it safeguards patient privacy by
limiting the potential privacy leakage arising from any contents shared across
the parties during the training process; and (3) it facilitates the ML model
training without relying on a centralized server. We demonstrate the
generalizability and power of DeCaPH on three distinct tasks using real-world
distributed medical datasets: patient mortality prediction using electronic
health records, cell-type classification using single-cell human genomes, and
pathology identification using chest radiology images. We demonstrate that the
ML models trained with DeCaPH framework have an improved utility-privacy
trade-off, showing it enables the models to have good performance while

the United States (U.S.). NHANES data is frequently used by biostatisticians
and clinical scientists to study health trends across the U.S., but every
analysis requires extensive data management and cleaning before use and this
repetitive data engineering collectively costs valuable research time and
decreases the reproducibility of analyses. Here, we introduce NHANES-GCP, a
Cloud Development Kit for Terraform (CDKTF) Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) and
Data Build Tool (dbt) resources built on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) that
automates the data engineering and management aspects of working with NHANES
data. With current GCP pricing, NHANES-GCP costs less than $2 to run and less
than $15/yr of ongoing costs for hosting the NHANES data, all while providing
researchers with clean data tables that can readily be integrated for
large-scale analyses. We provide examples of leveraging BigQuery ML to carry
out the process of selecting data, integrating data, training machine learning
and statistical models, and generating results all from a single SQL-like

sequencing is becoming a mainstay of clinical care for cancer patients. The
emergence of multi-institution sequencing data presents a powerful resource for
learning real-world evidence to enhance precision oncology. GENIE BPC, led by
the American Association for Cancer Research, establishes a unique database
linking genomic data with clinical information for patients treated at multiple
cancer centers. However, leveraging such multi-institutional sequencing data
presents significant challenges. Variations in gene panels result in loss of
information when the analysis is conducted on common gene sets. Additionally,
differences in sequencing techniques and patient heterogeneity across
institutions add complexity. High data dimensionality, sparse gene mutation
patterns, and weak signals at the individual gene level further complicate
matters. Motivated by these real-world challenges, we introduce the Bridge
model. It uses a quantile-matched latent variable approach to derive integrated
features to preserve information beyond common genes and maximize the
utilization of all available data while leveraging information sharing to
enhance both learning efficiency and the model's capacity to generalize. By
extracting harmonized and noise-reduced lower-dimensional latent variables, the

to enable data mining and analyses, especially across multi-institutional

for new automated and efficient approaches to handle the task. Several machine
learning-based methods have been proposed and evaluated to standardise
nomenclature. However, no studies have considered that RT patient records are
distributed across multiple data centres. This paper introduces a method that
emulates real-world environments to establish standardised nomenclature. This
is achieved by integrating decentralised real-time data and federated learning
(FL). A multimodal deep artificial neural network was proposed to standardise
RT data in federated settings. Three types of possible attributes were
extracted from the structures to train the deep learning models: tabular,
visual, and volumetric. Simulated experiments were carried out to train the
models across several scenarios including multiple data centres, input
modalities, and aggregation strategies. The models were compared against models
developed with single modalities in federated settings, in addition to models
trained in centralised settings. Categorical classification accuracy was
calculated on hold-out samples to inform the models performance. Our results
highlight the need for fusing multiple modalities when training such models,
with better performance reported with tabular-volumetric models. In addition,
we report comparable accuracy compared to models built in centralised settings.
This demonstrates the suitability of FL for handling the standardization task.
Additional ablation analyses showed that the total number of samples in the
data centres and the number of data centres highly affects the training process
and should be carefully considered when building standardisation models.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08999v1'>2402.08999v1</a></div>

gain monetary reward by selling their own models and improve local model
performance through the purchase of others' models. We propose an auction-based

learning (ML), develops global models through a private procedure without
direct access to local datasets. However, access to model updates (e.g.
gradient updates in deep neural networks) transferred between clients and
servers can reveal sensitive information to adversaries. Differential privacy
(DP) offers a framework that gives a privacy guarantee by adding certain
amounts of noise to parameters. This approach, although being effective in
terms of privacy, adversely affects model performance due to noise involvement.
Hence, it is always needed to find a balance between noise injection and the
sacrificed accuracy. To address this challenge, we propose adaptive noise
addition in FL which decides the value of injected noise based on features'
relative importance. Here, we first propose two effective methods for
prioritizing features in deep neural network models and then perturb models'
weights based on this information. Specifically, we try to figure out whether
the idea of adding more noise to less important parameters and less noise to
more important parameters can effectively save the model accuracy while
preserving privacy. Our experiments confirm this statement under some
conditions. The amount of noise injected, the proportion of parameters
involved, and the number of global iterations can significantly change the

proposed, where the central server aggregates gradients received from the
non-stragglers and gradient computed from a privacy-preservation global coded
dataset to mitigate the negative impact of the stragglers. However, when
aggregating these gradients, fixed weights are consistently applied across
iterations, neglecting the generation process of the global coded dataset and
the dynamic nature of the trained model over iterations. This oversight may
result in diminished learning performance. To overcome this drawback, we
propose a new method named adaptive coded federated learning (ACFL). In ACFL,
before the training, each device uploads a coded local dataset with additive
noise to the central server to generate a global coded dataset under privacy
preservation requirements. During each iteration of the training, the central
server aggregates the gradients received from the non-stragglers and the
gradient computed from the global coded dataset, where an adaptive policy for
varying the aggregation weights is designed. Under this policy, we optimize the

approach to better safeguard the privacy of client-side data by protecting

typically assume a uniform privacy budget for all records and provide
one-size-fits-all solutions that may not be adequate to meet each record's
privacy requirement. In this paper, we explore the uncharted territory of
cross-silo FL with record-level personalized differential privacy. We devise a
novel framework named rPDP-FL, employing a two-stage hybrid sampling scheme
with both client-level sampling and non-uniform record-level sampling to
accommodate varying privacy requirements. A critical and non-trivial problem is
to select the ideal per-record sampling probability q given the personalized
privacy budget {\epsilon}. We introduce a versatile solution named
Simulation-CurveFitting, allowing us to uncover a significant insight into the
nonlinear correlation between q and {\epsilon} and derive an elegant
mathematical model to tackle the problem. Our evaluation demonstrates that our

personalization is required for highly heterogeneous clients, but can be
challenging to achieve especially when they have small datasets. To address
this problem, we propose a PFL algorithm named PAC-PFL for learning
probabilistic models within a PAC-Bayesian framework that utilizes differential

learning models across decentralized data by aggregating model parameters. Our
approach extends this concept by aggregating "knowledge" derived from models,
instead of model parameters. We present a novel framework called CoDream, where
clients collaboratively optimize randomly initialized data using federated
optimization in the input data space, similar to how randomly initialized model
parameters are optimized in FL. Our key insight is that jointly optimizing this
data can effectively capture the properties of the global data distribution.
Sharing knowledge in data space offers numerous benefits: (1) model-agnostic
collaborative learning, i.e., different clients can have different model
architectures; (2) communication that is independent of the model size,
eliminating scalability concerns with model parameters; (3) compatibility with
secure aggregation, thus preserving the privacy benefits of federated learning;
(4) allowing of adaptive optimization of knowledge shared for personalized
learning. We empirically validate CoDream on standard FL tasks, demonstrating
competitive performance despite not sharing model parameters. Our code:

A typical solution involves segregating these parameters into shared and

Addressing this, we propose "Loop Improvement" (LI), a novel method enhancing
this separation and feature extraction without necessitating a central server
or data interchange among participants. Our experiments reveal LI's superiority
in several aspects: In personalized federated learning environments, LI
consistently outperforms the advanced FedALA algorithm in accuracy across
diverse scenarios. Additionally, LI's feature extractor closely matches the
performance achieved when aggregating data from all clients. In global model
contexts, employing LI with stacked personalized layers and an additional
network also yields comparable results to combined client data scenarios.
Furthermore, LI's adaptability extends to multi-task learning, streamlining the
extraction of common features across tasks and obviating the need for
simultaneous training. This approach not only enhances individual task
performance but also achieves accuracy levels on par with classic multi-task
learning methods where all tasks are trained simultaneously. LI integrates a

context of Fed-LT, existing works have predominantly centered on addressing the
data imbalance issue to enhance the efficacy of the generic global model while
neglecting the performance at the local level. In contrast, conventional
Personalized Federated Learning (pFL) techniques are primarily devised to
optimize personalized local models under the presumption of a balanced global
data distribution. This paper introduces an approach termed Federated Local and
Generic Model Training in Fed-LT (FedLoGe), which enhances both local and
generic model performance through the integration of representation learning
and classifier alignment within a neural collapse framework. Our investigation
reveals the feasibility of employing a shared backbone as a foundational
framework for capturing overarching global trends, while concurrently employing
individualized classifiers to encapsulate distinct refinements stemming from
each client's local features. Building upon this discovery, we establish the
Static Sparse Equiangular Tight Frame Classifier (SSE-C), inspired by neural
collapse principles that naturally prune extraneous noisy features and foster
the acquisition of potent data representations. Furthermore, leveraging
insights from imbalance neural collapse's classifier norm patterns, we develop
Global and Local Adaptive Feature Realignment (GLA-FR) via an auxiliary global
classifier and personalized Euclidean norm transfer to align global features

In response, we have identified that models derived from FL exhibit markedly
increased uncertainty when applied to data silos with unfamiliar distributions.
Consequently, we propose an innovative yet straightforward iterative framework,

freezing the final layer as an orthogonal classifier. We investigate the
training dynamics of the classifier by applying SVD to the weights motivated by
the observation that freezing weights results in constant singular values. We
find that there are differences when training in IID and non-IID settings.
Based on this finding, we introduce two regularization terms for local training

act as if it were in an IID setting regardless of the local data distribution,

personalized federated learning (MHPFL). Nevertheless, the problem of ensuring
data and model privacy, while achieving good model performance and keeping
communication and computation costs low remains open in MHPFL. To address this
problem, we propose a model-heterogeneous personalized Federated learning with
Mixture of Experts (pFedMoE) method. It assigns a shared homogeneous small
feature extractor and a local gating network for each client's local
heterogeneous large model. Firstly, during local training, the local
heterogeneous model's feature extractor acts as a local expert for personalized
feature (representation) extraction, while the shared homogeneous small feature
extractor serves as a global expert for generalized feature extraction. The
local gating network produces personalized weights for extracted
representations from both experts on each data sample. The three models form a
local heterogeneous MoE. The weighted mixed representation fuses generalized
and personalized features and is processed by the local heterogeneous large
model's header with personalized prediction information. The MoE and prediction
header are updated simultaneously. Secondly, the trained local homogeneous
small feature extractors are sent to the server for cross-client information
fusion via aggregation. Overall, pFedMoE enhances local model personalization
at a fine-grained data level, while supporting model heterogeneity.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01350v3'>2402.01350v3</a></div>

to explore. In this work we study a modern form of error feedback called EF21
(Richtarik et al., 2021) which offers the currently best-known theoretical

particular, while the theoretical communication complexity of EF21 depends on
the quadratic mean of certain smoothness parameters, we improve this dependence
to their arithmetic mean, which is always smaller, and can be substantially
smaller, especially in heterogeneous data regimes. We take the reader on a
journey of our discovery process. Starting with the idea of applying EF21 to an
equivalent reformulation of the underlying problem which (unfortunately)
requires (often impractical) machine cloning, we continue to the discovery of a
new weighted version of EF21 which can (fortunately) be executed without any

bidirectional compression with slower convergence rate. In this work, we
propose the Local Immediate Error Compensated SGD (LIEC-SGD) optimization
algorithm to break the above bottlenecks based on bidirectional compression and
carefully designed compensation approaches. Specifically, the bidirectional
compression technique is to reduce the communication cost, and the compensation
technique compensates the local compression error to the model update
immediately while only maintaining the global error variable on the server
throughout the iterations to boost its efficacy. Theoretically, we prove that
LIEC-SGD is superior to previous works in either the convergence rate or the

privacy preservation, communication efficiency, and robustness to fault and
adversarial behaviors. Although significant research efforts have been devoted
to addressing these challenges independently, their synthesis remains less
explored. In this paper, we propose TernaryVote, which combines a ternary
compressor and the majority vote mechanism to realize differential privacy,
gradient compression, and Byzantine resilience simultaneously. We theoretically
quantify the privacy guarantee through the lens of the emerging f-differential
privacy (DP) and the Byzantine resilience of the proposed algorithm.
Particularly, in terms of privacy guarantees, compared to the existing
sign-based approach StoSign, the proposed method improves the dimension
dependence on the gradient size and enjoys privacy amplification by mini-batch
sampling while ensuring a comparable convergence rate. We also prove that
TernaryVote is robust when less than 50% of workers are blind attackers, which
matches that of SIGNSGD with majority vote. Extensive experimental results
validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10816v1'>2402.10816v1</a></div>

In this paper, a novel zero trust framework for a power grid supply chain

GenAI-driven attack vectors (e.g., replay and protocol-type attacks),
assessment of tail risk-based stability measures, and mitigation of such
threats. First, a new zero trust system model of PGSC is designed and
formulated as a zero-trust problem that seeks to guarantee for a stable PGSC by

domain-specific generative adversarial networks (GAN)-based attack generation

sends status updates to a receiver. The challenge is to decide on the best time

A lower threshold leads to higher risk-sensitivity. The second strategy uses an

relaxing this assumption is still an open problem.
  In this paper, we present Pencil, the first private training framework for
collaborative learning that simultaneously offers data privacy, model privacy,
and extensibility to multiple data providers, without relying on the
non-colluding assumption. Our fundamental design principle is to construct the
n-party collaborative training protocol based on an efficient two-party
protocol, and meanwhile ensuring that switching to different data providers
during model training introduces no extra cost. We introduce several novel
cryptographic protocols to realize this design principle and conduct a rigorous
security and privacy analysis. Our comprehensive evaluations of Pencil
demonstrate that (i) models trained in plaintext and models trained privately
using Pencil exhibit nearly identical test accuracies; (ii) The training
overhead of Pencil is greatly reduced: Pencil achieves 10 ~ 260x higher
throughput and 2 orders of magnitude less communication than prior art; (iii)
Pencil is resilient against both existing and adaptive (white-box) attacks.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11166v1'>2403.11166v1</a></div>

to impractically high PI latency in existing PI systems, as ReLU requires the

Our experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet show that xMLP models consistently

traditional HE render it impractical for highly scalable scenarios.
Fortunately, a modern cryptographic scheme, Hybrid Homomorphic Encryption

privacy-preserving collaborative training across a multitude of clients.
However, new approaches to FL often discuss their contributions involving small
deep-learning models only and focus on training full models on clients. In the
wake of Foundation Models (FM), the reality is different for many deep learning
applications. Typically, FMs have already been pre-trained across a wide
variety of tasks and can be fine-tuned to specific downstream tasks over
significantly smaller datasets than required for full model training. However,
access to such datasets is often challenging. By its design, FL can help to
open data silos. With this survey, we introduce a novel taxonomy focused on
computational and communication efficiency, the vital elements to make use of
FMs in FL systems. We discuss the benefits and drawbacks of parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) for FL applications, elaborate on the readiness of FL
frameworks to work with FMs and provide future research opportunities on how to
evaluate generative models in FL as well as the interplay of privacy and PEFT.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04472v2'>2401.04472v2</a></div>

models has become an important scenario (i.e., the \textbf{small-to-large

have started to explore this area, they face limitations in fully covering the
parameter space of the global model. In this paper, we propose a method called
\textbf{FedBRB} (\underline{B}lock-wise \underline{R}olling and weighted

models to train all blocks of the large global model, and broadcasts the
trained parameters to the entire space for faster information interaction.
Experiments demonstrate FedBRB yields substantial performance gains, achieving
state-of-the-art results in this scenario. Moreover, FedBRB using only minimal

Averaging (FedAvg) are the most prominent methods for FL applications. Despite
their simplicity and popularity, the theoretical understanding of local
optimization methods is far from clear. This dissertation aims to advance the
theoretical foundation of local methods in the following three directions.
  First, we establish sharp bounds for FedAvg, the most popular algorithm in
Federated Learning. We demonstrate how FedAvg may suffer from a notion we call
iterate bias, and how an additional third-order smoothness assumption may
mitigate this effect and lead to better convergence rates. We explain this
phenomenon from a Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) perspective.
  Second, we propose Federated Accelerated Stochastic Gradient Descent (FedAc),
the first principled acceleration of FedAvg, which provably improves the
convergence rate and communication efficiency. Our technique uses on a
potential-based perturbed iterate analysis, a novel stability analysis of
generalized accelerated SGD, and a strategic tradeoff between acceleration and
stability.
  Third, we study the Federated Composite Optimization problem, which extends
the classic smooth setting by incorporating a shared non-smooth regularizer. We
show that direct extensions of FedAvg may suffer from the "curse of primal
averaging," resulting in slow convergence. As a solution, we propose a new

cases and applications that depend on a certain level of Quality of Service
(QoS) to operate smoothly. Predicting the QoS in a timely manner is of high
importance, especially for safety-critical applications as in the case of
vehicular communications. Although until recent years the QoS prediction has
been carried out by centralized Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions, a
number of privacy, computational, and operational concerns have emerged.
Alternative solutions have been surfaced (e.g. Split Learning, Federated
Learning), distributing AI tasks of reduced complexity across nodes, while
preserving the privacy of the data. However, new challenges rise when it comes
to scalable distributed learning approaches, taking into account the
heterogeneous nature of future wireless networks. The current work proposes
DISTINQT, a privacy-aware distributed learning framework for QoS prediction.
Our framework supports multiple heterogeneous nodes, in terms of data types and
model architectures, by sharing computations across them. This, enables the
incorporation of diverse knowledge into a sole learning process that will
enhance the robustness and generalization capabilities of the final QoS
prediction model. DISTINQT also contributes to data privacy preservation by
encoding any raw input data into a non-linear latent representation before any
transmission. Evaluation results showcase that our framework achieves a
statistically identical performance compared to its centralized version and an
average performance improvement of up to 65% against six state-of-the-art
centralized baseline solutions in the Tele-Operated Driving use case.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10158v1'>2401.10158v1</a></div>

participate to next round. However, the cost by maintaining an active state is
very large when there are a huge number of participating vehicles. In this

powerful capability for generalization and sample-efficient adaptation to new
domains. However, training modular models, particularly in the early stages,
poses challenges due to the optimization difficulties arising from their
intrinsic sparse connectivity. Leveraging the knowledge from monolithic models,
using techniques such as knowledge distillation, is likely to facilitate the
training of modular models and enable them to integrate knowledge from multiple
models pretrained on diverse sources. Nevertheless, conventional knowledge
distillation approaches are not tailored to modular models and can fail when
directly applied due to the unique architectures and the enormous number of
parameters involved. Motivated by these challenges, we propose a general
module-to-module knowledge distillation (m2mKD) method for transferring
knowledge between modules. Our approach involves teacher modules split from a
pretrained monolithic model, and student modules of a modular model. m2mKD
separately combines these modules with a shared meta model and encourages the
student module to mimic the behaviour of the teacher module. We evaluate the
effectiveness of m2mKD on two distinct modular neural architectures: Neural
Attentive Circuits (NACs) and Vision Mixture-of-Experts (V-MoE). By applying
m2mKD to NACs, we achieve significant improvements in IID accuracy on
Tiny-ImageNet (up to 5.6%) and OOD robustness on Tiny-ImageNet-R (up to 4.2%).
On average, we observe a 1% gain in both ImageNet and ImageNet-R. The
V-MoE-Base model trained using m2mKD also achieves 3.5% higher accuracy than
end-to-end training on ImageNet. The experimental results demonstrate that our

(FL) with low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations holds immense promise.
However, many challenges persist in terms of feasibility, learning efficiency,
and convergence. These hurdles stem from the bottleneck in communication,
characterized by sporadic and irregular connectivity between LEO satellites and
ground stations, coupled with the limited computation capability of satellite
edge computing (SEC). This paper proposes a novel FL-SEC framework that
empowers LEO satellites to execute large-scale machine learning (ML) tasks
onboard efficiently. Its key components include i) personalized learning via
divide-and-conquer, which identifies and eliminates redundant satellite images
and converts complex multi-class classification problems to simple binary
classification, enabling rapid and energy-efficient training of lightweight ML
models suitable for IoT/edge devices on satellites; ii) orbital model
retraining, which generates an aggregated "orbital model" per orbit and
retrains it before sending to the ground station, significantly reducing the
required communication rounds. We conducted experiments using Jetson Nano, an
edge device closely mimicking the limited compute on LEO satellites, and a real
satellite dataset. The results underscore the effectiveness of our approach,
highlighting SEC's ability to run lightweight ML models on real and
high-resolution satellite imagery. Our approach dramatically reduces FL
convergence time by nearly 30 times, and satellite energy consumption down to
as low as 1.38 watts, all while maintaining an exceptional accuracy of up to
96%.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15541v1'>2401.15541v1</a></div>

learning (FL) enables satellites to train a machine learning (ML) model
collaboratively without having to share the raw data. This paper introduces a
scheme for scheduling on-board FL for constellations connected with intra-orbit
inter-satellite links. The proposed scheme utilizes the predictable visibility
pattern between satellites and ground station (GS), both at the individual
satellite level and cumulatively within the entire orbit, to mitigate
intermittent connectivity and best use of available time. To this end, two
distinct schedulers are employed: one for coordinating the FL procedures among
orbits, and the other for controlling those within each orbit. These two
schedulers cooperatively determine the appropriate time to perform global
updates in GS and then allocate suitable duration to satellites within each
orbit for local training, proportional to usable time until next global update.
This scheme leads to improved test accuracy within a shorter time.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09105v1'>2402.09105v1</a></div>

a client participating in a Federated Online Learning to Rank (FOLTR) system.
In a FOLTR system, a ranker is learned by aggregating local updates to the
global ranking model. Local updates are learned in an online manner at a
client-level using queries and implicit interactions that have occurred within
that specific client. By doing so, each client's local data is not shared with
other clients or with a centralised search service, while at the same time
clients can benefit from an effective global ranking model learned from
contributions of each client in the federation.
  In this paper, we study an effective and efficient unlearning method that can
remove a client's contribution without compromising the overall ranker
effectiveness and without needing to retrain the global ranker from scratch. A
key challenge is how to measure whether the model has unlearned the
contributions from the client $c^*$ that has requested removal. For this, we
instruct $c^*$ to perform a poisoning attack (add noise to this client updates)
and then we measure whether the impact of the attack is lessened when the
unlearning process has taken place. Through experiments on four datasets, we
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the unlearning strategy under
different combinations of parameter settings.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13410v1'>2401.13410v1</a></div>

that the generalization performance of a client can be improved only by

by comparing the workloads of adjacent partitions. In addition, ExDyna supports
online threshold scaling, which estimates the accurate threshold of gradient
selection on-the-fly. Accordingly, ExDyna can satisfy the user-required
sparsity level during a training period regardless of models and datasets.
Therefore, ExDyna can enhance the scalability of distributed training systems
by preserving near-optimal gradient sparsification cost. In experiments, ExDyna
outperformed state-of-the-art sparsifiers in terms of training speed and
sparsification performance while achieving high accuracy.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13781v1'>2402.13781v1</a></div>

research on SFL algorithm development, the convergence analysis of SFL is
missing in the literature, and this paper aims to fill this gap. The analysis
of SFL can be more challenging than that of federated learning (FL), due to the
potential dual-paced updates at the clients and the main server. We provide
convergence analysis of SFL for strongly convex and general convex objectives
on heterogeneous data. The convergence rates are $O(1/T)$ and
$O(1/\sqrt[3]{T})$, respectively, where $T$ denotes the total number of rounds
for SFL training. We further extend the analysis to non-convex objectives and
where some clients may be unavailable during training. Numerical experiments

Standard FL, which employs a single server, can only support a limited number
of users, leading to degraded learning capability. In this work, we consider a
multi-server FL framework, referred to as \emph{Confederated Learning} (CFL),
in order to accommodate a larger number of users. A CFL system is composed of
multiple networked edge servers, with each server connected to an individual
set of users. Decentralized collaboration among servers is leveraged to harness
all users' data for model training. Due to the potentially massive number of
users involved, it is crucial to reduce the communication overhead of the CFL
system. We propose a stochastic gradient method for distributed learning in the
CFL framework. The proposed method incorporates a conditionally-triggered user
selection (CTUS) mechanism as the central component to effectively reduce
communication overhead. Relying on a delicately designed triggering condition,
the CTUS mechanism allows each server to select only a small number of users to
upload their gradients, without significantly jeopardizing the convergence
performance of the algorithm. Our theoretical analysis reveals that the
proposed algorithm enjoys a linear convergence rate. Simulation results show

While CNC-based mechanisms have garnered attention, their effectiveness in

potential joint sparsity of the delay-Doppler-angle (DDA) domain channel, the
channel estimation problem is transformed into a sparse recovery problem. To
solve it, we first apply the spike and slab prior model to iteratively estimate
the support set of the channel matrix, and a higher-accuracy parameter update
rule relying on the identified support set is introduced into the iteration.
Then the specific values of the channel elements corresponding to the support
set are estimated by the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) method. Both our
simulation results and analysis demonstrate that the proposed JSPL channel
estimation scheme achieves an improved performance over the representative
state-of-the-art baseline schemes, despite its reduced pilot overhead.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03771v1'>2403.03771v1</a></div>

broad range of emerging services in next-generation wireless networks. URLLC
fundamentally relies on the network's ability to proactively determine whether
sufficient resources are available to support the URLLC traffic, and thus,
prevent so-called cell overloads. Nonetheless, achieving accurate
quality-of-service (QoS) predictions for URLLC user equipment (UEs) and
preventing cell overloads are very challenging tasks. This is due to dependency
of the QoS metrics (latency and reliability) on traffic and channel statistics,
users' mobility, and interdependent performance across UEs. In this paper, a
new QoS-aware UE admission control approach is developed to proactively
estimate QoS for URLLC UEs, prior to associating them with a cell, and
accordingly, admit only a subset of UEs that do not lead to a cell overload. To
this end, an optimization problem is formulated to find an efficient UE
admission control policy, cognizant of UEs' QoS requirements and cell-level
load dynamics. To solve this problem, a new machine learning based method is
proposed that builds on (deep) neural contextual bandits, a suitable framework
for dealing with nonlinear bandit problems. In fact, the UE admission
controller is treated as a bandit agent that observes a set of network
measurements (context) and makes admission control decisions based on
context-dependent QoS (reward) predictions. The simulation results show that
the proposed scheme can achieve near-optimal performance and yield substantial

federated learning (FL) prone to arbitrary manipulation. The natural approach
to robustify FL against adversarial clients is to replace the simple averaging
operation at the server in the standard $\mathsf{FedAvg}$ algorithm by a
\emph{robust averaging rule}. While a significant amount of work has been
devoted to studying the convergence of federated {\em robust averaging} (which
we denote by $\mathsf{FedRo}$), prior work has largely ignored the impact of
{\em client subsampling} and {\em local steps}, two fundamental FL
characteristics. While client subsampling increases the effective fraction of
Byzantine clients, local steps increase the drift between the local updates
computed by honest (i.e., non-Byzantine) clients. Consequently, a careless
deployment of $\mathsf{FedRo}$ could yield poor performance. We validate this
observation by presenting an in-depth analysis of $\mathsf{FedRo}$ tightly
analyzing the impact of client subsampling and local steps. Specifically, we
present a sufficient condition on client subsampling for nearly-optimal
convergence of $\mathsf{FedRo}$ (for smooth non-convex loss). Also, we show
that the rate of improvement in learning accuracy {\em diminishes} with respect
to the number of clients subsampled, as soon as the sample size exceeds a
threshold value. Interestingly, we also observe that under a careful choice of

Different from most existing resilient approaches, which perform convergence
analysis based on strongly-convex loss function or homogeneously distributed
dataset, we conduct convergence analysis for not only strongly-convex but also
non-convex loss function over heterogeneous dataset. According to our
theoretical analysis, as long as the fraction of dataset from malicious users
is less than half, RAGA can achieve convergence at rate
$\mathcal{O}({1}/{T^{2/3- \delta}})$ where $T$ is the iteration number and
$\delta \in (0, 2/3)$ for non-convex loss function, and at linear rate for
strongly-convex loss function. Moreover, stationary point or global optimal
solution is proved to obtainable as data heterogeneity vanishes. Experimental
results corroborate the robustness of RAGA to Byzantine attacks and verifies
the advantage of RAGA over baselines on convergence performance under various

for training machine learning models in a decentralized manner while also

Therefore, we introduce FedSiKD, which incorporates knowledge distillation (KD)

traditional centralized learning approach. Generally speaking, FL is a
decentralized approach that allows for collaborative training of Machine
Learning (ML) models across multiple local nodes, ensuring data privacy and
security while leveraging diverse datasets. Conventional FL, however, is
susceptible to gradient inversion attacks, restrictively enforces a uniform
architecture on local models, and suffers from model heterogeneity (model
drift) due to non-IID local datasets. To mitigate some of these challenges, the
new paradigm of Federated Knowledge Distillation (FKD) has emerged. FDK is
developed based on the concept of Knowledge Distillation (KD), which involves
extraction and transfer of a large and well-trained teacher model's knowledge
to lightweight student models. FKD, however, still faces the model drift issue.
Intuitively speaking, not all knowledge is universally beneficial due to the
inherent diversity of data among local nodes. This calls for innovative
mechanisms to evaluate the relevance and effectiveness of each client's
knowledge for others, to prevent propagation of adverse knowledge. In this
context, the paper proposes Effective Knowledge Fusion (KnFu) algorithm that
evaluates knowledge of local models to only fuse semantic neighbors' effective
knowledge for each client. The KnFu is a personalized effective knowledge
fusion scheme for each client, that analyzes effectiveness of different local
models' knowledge prior to the aggregation phase. Comprehensive experiments
were performed on MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets illustrating effectiveness of the
proposed KnFu in comparison to its state-of-the-art counterparts. A key
conclusion of the work is that in scenarios with large and highly heterogeneous
local datasets, local training could be preferable to knowledge fusion-based
solutions.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11892v1'>2403.11892v1</a></div>

Because of the underutilization of numerous edge devices and additional

eliminate the restriction on the one-to-one mapping between source domains and
local clients. Furthermore, a dynamic query metric is introduced to
automatically search the suitable domain label for each sample, which includes
two-substep text-image alignments based on prompt tuning without

different from the underlying global distribution. This creates a weight
divergence issue and reduces federated learning performance. This work focuses
on improving federated learning performance for skewed data distribution across

ground truth labels. This assumption becomes especially problematic in
hierarchical wireless networks (HWNs), where edge networks contain a large
amount of unlabeled data, resulting in slower convergence rates and increased
processing times, particularly when dealing with two layers of model
aggregation. To address these issues, we introduce a novel framework, Clustered
Federated Semi-Supervised Learning (CFSL), designed for more realistic HWN
scenarios. Our approach leverages a best-performing specialized model
algorithm, wherein each device is assigned a specialized model that is highly
adept at generating accurate pseudo-labels for unlabeled data, even when the
data stems from diverse environments. We validate the efficacy of CFSL through
extensive experiments, comparing it with existing methods highlighted in recent
literature. Our numerical results demonstrate that CFSL significantly improves
upon key metrics such as testing accuracy, labeling accuracy, and labeling
latency under varying proportions of labeled and unlabeled data while also
accommodating the non-IID nature of the data and the unique characteristics of
wireless edge networks.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10646v1'>2401.10646v1</a></div>

However, existing prediction methods may not be suitable due to the

we develop a home charging prediction method using historical smart meter data.
Different from NILM detecting EV charging that has already occurred, our method

enhancing its utility for charging management. Specifically, our method,
leverages a self-attention mechanism-based transformer model, employing a

paradigm, particularly gaining momentum in domains with confidential and

terms of transmission rates and susceptibility to transmission errors, poses
major challenges for wireless FL's convergence speed and accuracy. The
challenge is more acute for hostile environments without a metric that
authenticates the data quality and security profile of the clients. In this
context, this paper proposes a novel risk-aware accelerated FL framework that
accounts for the clients heterogeneity in the amount of possessed data,
transmission rates, transmission errors, and trustworthiness. Classifying
clients according to their location-dependent performance and trustworthiness
profiles, we propose a dynamic risk-aware global model aggregation scheme that
allows clients to participate in descending order of their transmission rates
and an ascending trustworthiness constraint. In particular, the transmission
rate is the dominant participation criterion for initial rounds to accelerate
the convergence speed. Our model then progressively relaxes the transmission
rate restriction to explore more training data at cell-edge clients. The
aggregation rounds incorporate a debiasing factor that accounts for
transmission errors. Risk-awareness is enabled by a validation set, where the
base station eliminates non-trustworthy clients at the fine-tuning stage. The
proposed scheme is benchmarked against a conservative scheme (i.e., only
allowing trustworthy devices) and an aggressive scheme (i.e., oblivious to the
trust metric). The numerical results highlight the superiority of the proposed

(EC) environments to process the proliferation of data generated by edge
devices. By collaboratively optimizing the global machine learning models on
distributed edge devices, FL circumvents the need for transmitting raw data and
enhances user privacy. Despite practical successes, FL still confronts
significant challenges including constrained edge device resources, multiple
tasks deployment, and data heterogeneity. However, existing studies focus on
mitigating the FL training costs of each single task whereas neglecting the
resource consumption across multiple tasks in heterogeneous FL scenarios. In
this paper, we propose Heterogeneous Federated Learning with Local Parameter
Sharing (FedLPS) to fill this gap. FedLPS leverages principles from transfer
learning to facilitate the deployment of multiple tasks on a single device by
dividing the local model into a shareable encoder and task-specific encoders.
To further reduce resource consumption, a channel-wise model pruning algorithm
that shrinks the footprint of local models while accounting for both data and
system heterogeneity is employed in FedLPS. Additionally, a novel heterogeneous
model aggregation algorithm is proposed to aggregate the heterogeneous
predictors in FedLPS. We implemented the proposed FedLPS on a real FL platform

to handle high-volume, non-iid client data while ensuring data privacy.
However, heterogeneous edge devices owned by clients may impose varying degrees
of resource constraints, causing computation and communication bottlenecks for
PFL. Federated Dropout has emerged as a popular strategy to address this
challenge, wherein only a subset of the global model, i.e. a
\textit{sub-model}, is trained on a client's device, thereby reducing
computation and communication overheads. Nevertheless, the dropout-based
model-pruning strategy may introduce bias, particularly towards non-iid local
data. When biased sub-models absorb highly divergent parameters from other
clients, performance degradation becomes inevitable. In response, we propose
federated learning with stochastic parameter update (FedSPU). Unlike dropout
that tailors the global model to small-size local sub-models, FedSPU maintains
the full model architecture on each device but randomly freezes a certain
percentage of neurons in the local model during training while updating the
remaining neurons. This approach ensures that a portion of the local model
remains personalized, thereby enhancing the model's robustness against biased
parameters from other clients. Experimental results demonstrate that FedSPU
outperforms federated dropout by 7.57\% on average in terms of accuracy.
Furthermore, an introduced early stopping scheme leads to a significant
reduction of the training time by \(24.8\%\sim70.4\%\) while maintaining high

using a neural computation algorithm which can be distributed across several
machines. Our modular distributed deep learning paradigm, termed \textit{neural
pathways}, can achieve arbitrary accuracy while only loading a small number of
parameters into GPU VRAM. Formally, we prove that for every error level
$\varepsilon&gt;0$ and every Lipschitz function $f:[0,1]^n\to \mathbb{R}$, one can
construct a neural pathways model which uniformly approximates $f$ to
$\varepsilon$ accuracy over $[0,1]^n$ while only requiring networks of
$\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-1})$ parameters to be loaded in memory and
$\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-1}\log(\varepsilon^{-1}))$ to be loaded during the
forward pass. This improves the optimal bounds for traditional non-distributed
deep learning models, namely ReLU MLPs, which need
$\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-n/2})$ parameters to achieve the same accuracy. The
only other available deep learning model that breaks the curse of
dimensionality is MLPs with super-expressive activation functions. However, we
demonstrate that these models have an infinite VC dimension, even with bounded
depth and width restrictions, unlike the neural pathways model. This implies
that only the latter generalizes. Our analysis is validated experimentally in
both regression and classification tasks, demonstrating that our model exhibits
superior performance compared to larger centralized benchmarks.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03460v1'>2402.03460v1</a></div>

first class of literature is about distributed computing and focuses on the
situation, where the dataset size is too huge to be comfortably handled by one
single computer. In this case, a distributed computation system with multiple

those minibatch gradient related optimization techniques, which have been

demonstrated exceptional generalization and accuracy due to training on huge

are limited by memory constraints at such scales. This paper proposes an
asynchronous decentralized training paradigm for large modern deep learning
models that harnesses the compute power of regular heterogeneous PCs with
limited resources connected across the internet to achieve favourable
performance metrics. Ravnest facilitates decentralized training by efficiently
organizing compute nodes into clusters with similar data transfer rates and
compute capabilities, without necessitating that each node hosts the entire
model. These clusters engage in $\textit{Zero-Bubble Asynchronous Model
Parallel}$ training, and a $\textit{Parallel Multi-Ring All-Reduce}$ method is
employed to effectively execute global parameter averaging across all clusters.
We have framed our asynchronous SGD loss function as a block structured
optimization problem with delayed updates and derived an optimal convergence
rate of $O\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{K}}\right)$. We further discuss linear speedup

network models with ever-growing parameter numbers. Training such large-scale
models typically requires massive memory and computing resources that exceed
those of a single GPU, necessitating distributed training. As GPU performance
has rapidly evolved in recent years, computation time has shrunk, thereby
increasing the proportion of communication in the overall training time.
Therefore, optimizing communication for distributed training has become an
urgent issue. In this article, we briefly introduce the general architecture of
distributed deep neural network training and analyze relationships among
Parallelization Strategy, Collective Communication Library, and Network from
the perspective of communication optimization, which forms a three-layer
paradigm. We then review current representative research advances with this
three-layer paradigm. We find that layers in the current three-layer paradigm
are relatively independent, but there is a rich design space for cross-layer
collaborative optimization in distributed training scenarios. Therefore, we
further advocate a communication-efficient five-layer paradigm underlining
opportunities for collaboration designs and look forward to the perspectives of
"Vertical", "Horizontal", "Intra-Inter" and "Host-Net" collaboration designs.

DNN training flows should scale their congestion window size based on the

Model-parallel training, when the model architecture is partitioned
sequentially between workers, is a popular approach for training modern models.
Information compression can be applied to decrease workers communication time,
as it is often a bottleneck in such systems. This work explores how
simultaneous compression of activations and gradients in model-parallel
distributed training setup affects convergence. We analyze compression methods
such as quantization and TopK compression, and also experiment with error
compensation techniques. Moreover, we employ TopK with AQ-SGD per-batch error
feedback approach. We conduct experiments on image classification and language
model fine-tuning tasks. Our findings demonstrate that gradients require milder
compression rates than activations. We observe that $K=10\%$ is the lowest TopK
compression level, which does not harm model convergence severely. Experiments
also show that models trained with TopK perform well only when compression is
also applied during inference. We find that error feedback techniques do not
improve model-parallel training compared to plain compression, but allow model
inference without compression with almost no quality drop. Finally, when
applied with the AQ-SGD approach, TopK stronger than with $ K=30\%$ worsens
model performance significantly.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07788v1'>2401.07788v1</a></div>
