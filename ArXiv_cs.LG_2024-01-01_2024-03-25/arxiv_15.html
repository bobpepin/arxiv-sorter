manual architecture design to Neural Architecture Search (NAS). This transition
demands an efficient and responsive anytime NAS approach that is capable of
returning current optimal architectures within any given time budget while
progressively enhancing architecture quality with increased budget allocation.
However, the area of research on Anytime NAS for tabular data remains
unexplored. To this end, we introduce ATLAS, the first anytime NAS approach
tailored for tabular data. ATLAS introduces a novel two-phase
filtering-and-refinement optimization scheme with joint optimization, combining
the strengths of both paradigms of training-free and training-based
architecture evaluation. Specifically, in the filtering phase, ATLAS employs a
new zero-cost proxy specifically designed for tabular data to efficiently
estimate the performance of candidate architectures, thereby obtaining a set of
promising architectures. Subsequently, in the refinement phase, ATLAS leverages
a fixed-budget search algorithm to schedule the training of the promising
candidates, so as to accurately identify the optimal architecture. To jointly
optimize the two phases for anytime NAS, we also devise a budget-aware
coordinator that delivers high NAS performance within constraints. Experimental
evaluations demonstrate that our ATLAS can obtain a good-performing
architecture within any predefined time budget and return better architectures
as and when a new time budget is made available. Overall, it reduces the search
time on tabular data by up to 82.75x compared to existing NAS approaches.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10318v1'>2403.10318v1</a></div>

datasets to downstream tasks with enhanced performance. It transfers all
knowledge to downstream tasks without discriminating which part is necessary or
unnecessary, which may lead to negative transfer. In comparison, knowledge
transfer in nature is much more efficient. When passing genetic information to
descendants, ancestors encode only the essential knowledge into genes, which
act as the medium. Inspired by that, we adopt a recent concept called
``learngene'' and refine its structures by mimicking the structures of natural
genes. We propose the Genetic Transfer Learning (GTL) -- a framework to copy
the evolutionary process of organisms into neural networks. GTL trains a
population of networks, selects superior learngenes by tournaments, performs
learngene mutations, and passes the learngenes to next generations. Finally, we
successfully extract the learngenes of VGG11 and ResNet12. We show that the
learngenes bring the descendant networks instincts and strong learning ability:
with 20% parameters, the learngenes bring 12% and 16% improvements of accuracy
on CIFAR-FS and miniImageNet. Besides, the learngenes have the scalability and
adaptability on the downstream structure of networks and datasets. Overall, we
offer a novel insight that transferring core knowledge via learngenes may be
sufficient and efficient for neural networks.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08139v1'>2401.08139v1</a></div>

data efficiency, but it faces the challenge of task interference, where
optimizing one task objective may inadvertently compromise the performance of

parameters, free from interference, on top of shared features. However,
manually designing such architectures is cumbersome, as practitioners need to
balance between the overall performance across all tasks and the higher
computational cost induced by the newly added parameters. In this work, we
propose \textit{InterroGate}, a novel multi-task learning (MTL) architecture
designed to mitigate task interference while optimizing inference computational
efficiency. We employ a learnable gating mechanism to automatically balance the
shared and task-specific representations while preserving the performance of
all tasks. Crucially, the patterns of parameter sharing and specialization
dynamically learned during training, become fixed at inference, resulting in a
static, optimized MTL architecture. Through extensive empirical evaluations, we

decoder-focused architectures have considerably improved multitask performance
by refining task predictions using the features of other related tasks.
However, most of these refinement methods fail to simultaneously capture local

adeptly captures local, global, and cross-task interactions using our novel

its ability to manipulate task affinity matrices in a manner that is optimally

Considering the success of graph convolution in modeling topology-aware
features from skeleton data, recent methods commonly operate graph convolution
on separate entities and use late fusion for interactive action recognition,
which can barely model the mutual semantic relationships between pairwise
entities. To this end, we propose a mutual excitation graph convolutional
network (me-GCN) by stacking mutual excitation graph convolution (me-GC)
layers. Specifically, me-GC uses a mutual topology excitation module to firstly
extract adjacency matrices from individual entities and then adaptively model
the mutual constraints between them. Moreover, me-GC extends the above idea and
further uses a mutual feature excitation module to extract and merge deep
features from pairwise entities. Compared with graph convolution, our proposed
me-GC gradually learns mutual information in each layer and each stage of graph
convolution operations. Extensive experiments on a challenging hand-to-hand

role of permutation symmetry in reducing post-training barriers through network
permutation. However, these post-hoc methods, demanding extra computations, are
less effective for larger, complex models (e.g., ViT, LLM) due to numerous
permutation matrices. Thus, in this paper, we study training-time neuron
alignment. Our hypothesis suggests that training-time permutation subspace can
reduce LMC barriers for free. We find that pruning at initialization supports
this. Beyond pruning, we introduce TNA-PFN, a simple yet lossless algorithm
using a partial gradient mask during training. TNA-PFN is theoretically and
empirically validated for reducing LMC barriers. It excels in wide model fusion

diverse, large-scale model repository while meticulously considering the
intricate connections between tasks and models. The key insight is to map all
models and historical tasks into a transfer-related subspace, where the

transferability. A large vision model, as a proxy, infers a new task's

stochastic computing approaches for performing image processing tasks.
Memristors with inherent stochasticity readily introduce probability into the
computations and thus enable stochastic image processing computations. Here, we
present a stochastic computing approach for edge detection, a fundamental image
processing technique, facilitated with memristor-enabled stochastic logics.
Specifically, we integrate the memristors with logic circuits and harness the
stochasticity from the memristors to realize compact stochastic logics for
stochastic number encoding and processing. The stochastic numbers, exhibiting
well-regulated probabilities and correlations, can be processed to perform
logic operations with statistical probabilities. This can facilitate
lightweight stochastic edge detection for edge visual scenarios characterized
with high-level noise errors. As a practical demonstration, we implement a
hardware stochastic Roberts cross operator using the stochastic logics, and
prove its exceptional edge detection performance, remarkably, with 95% less
computational cost while withstanding 50% bit-flip errors. The results
underscore the great potential of our stochastic edge detection approach in
developing lightweight, error-tolerant edge vision hardware and systems for
autonomous driving, virtual/augmented reality, medical imaging diagnosis,
industrial automation, and beyond.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16908v2'>2402.16908v2</a></div>

However, their widespread adoption has raised concerns about security in the

study, we address this gap by introducing SpecFormer, specifically designed to
enhance ViTs' resilience against adversarial attacks, with support from
carefully derived theoretical guarantees. We establish local Lipschitz bounds
for the self-attention layer and introduce a novel approach, Maximum Singular
Value Penalization (MSVP), to attain precise control over these bounds. We
seamlessly integrate MSVP into ViTs' attention layers, using the power
iteration method for enhanced computational efficiency. The modified model,
SpecFormer, effectively reduces the spectral norms of attention weight
matrices, thereby enhancing network local Lipschitzness. This, in turn, leads
to improved training efficiency and robustness. Extensive experiments on CIFAR

projection head on top of the encoder during training, then discarding it and
using the pre-projection representations. Despite its proven practical
effectiveness, the reason behind the success of this technique is poorly
understood. The pre-projection representations are not directly optimized by
the loss function, raising the question: what makes them better? In this work,
we provide a rigorous theoretical answer to this question. We start by
examining linear models trained with self-supervised contrastive loss. We
reveal that the implicit bias of training algorithms leads to layer-wise
progressive feature weighting, where features become increasingly unequal as we
go deeper into the layers. Consequently, lower layers tend to have more
normalized and less specialized representations. We theoretically characterize
scenarios where such representations are more beneficial, highlighting the
intricate interplay between data augmentation and input features. Additionally,
we demonstrate that introducing non-linearity into the network allows lower
layers to learn features that are completely absent in higher layers. Finally,
we show how this mechanism improves the robustness in supervised contrastive
learning and supervised learning. We empirically validate our results through
various experiments on CIFAR-10/100, UrbanCars and shifted versions of
ImageNet. We also introduce a potential alternative to projection head, which
offers a more interpretable and controllable design.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11391v1'>2403.11391v1</a></div>

that the increased receptive field in the temporal dimension provided by DAS
could lead to benefits also to the spatial receptive field. More specifically,
we leverage DAS to guide the reshaping of the spatial receptive field by

fundamental memory bottlenecks in training machine learning systems. While
compute-in-memory (CIM) approaches can address the so-called memory-wall (i.e.
energy dissipated due to repeated memory read access) they are agnostic to the
energy dissipated due to repeated memory writes at the precision required for
training (the update-wall), and they don't account for the energy dissipated
when transferring information between short-term and long-term memories (the
consolidation-wall). The LIM paradigm proposes that these bottlenecks, too, can
be overcome if the energy barrier of physical memories is adaptively modulated
such that the dynamics of memory updates and consolidation match the Lyapunov
dynamics of gradient-descent training of an AI model. In this paper, we derive
new theoretical lower bounds on energy dissipation when training AI systems
using different LIM approaches. The analysis presented here is model-agnostic
and highlights the trade-off between energy efficiency and the speed of
training. The resulting non-equilibrium energy-efficiency bounds have a similar
flavor as that of Landauer's energy-dissipation bounds. We also extend these
limits by taking into account the number of floating-point operations (FLOPs)
used for training, the size of the AI model, and the precision of the training
parameters. Our projections suggest that the energy-dissipation lower-bound to
train a brain scale AI system (comprising of $10^{15}$ parameters) using LIM is

handling latency- and resource-critical deep neural network (DNN) inference
tasks. Among the most computationally intensive operations in a neural network
(NN) is the dot product between the feature and weight vectors. Thus, some
previous FPGA acceleration works have proposed mapping neurons with quantized
inputs and outputs directly to lookup tables (LUTs) for hardware
implementation. In these works, the boundaries of the neurons coincide with the
boundaries of the LUTs. We propose relaxing these boundaries and mapping entire
sub-networks to a single LUT. As the sub-networks are absorbed within the LUT,
the NN topology and precision within a partition do not affect the size of the
lookup tables generated. Therefore, we utilize fully connected layers with
floating-point precision inside each partition, which benefit from being
universal function approximators, with rigid sparsity and quantization enforced
only between partitions, where the NN topology becomes exposed to the circuit
topology. Although cheap to implement, this approach can lead to very deep NNs,
and so to tackle challenges like vanishing gradients, we also introduce skip
connections inside the partitions. The resulting methodology can be seen as
training DNNs with a specific sparsity pattern that allows them to be mapped to
much shallower circuit-level networks, thereby significantly improving latency.
We validate our proposed method on a known latency-critical task, jet
substructure tagging, and on the classical computer vision task, the digit
classification using MNIST. Our approach allows for greater function
expressivity within the LUTs compared to existing work, leading to lower
latency NNs for the same accuracy.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00849v1'>2403.00849v1</a></div>

vital for deploying large models on devices with limited computational
resources. However, the selection of quantization hyperparameters, like the
number of bits and value range for weight quantization, remains an

including optical transceivers, LIDAR, bio-sensing, photonic quantum computing,

sizes of ML models, photonics-based accelerators are getting special attention
as a sustainable solution because they can perform ML inferences with multiple
orders of magnitude higher energy efficiency than CMOS-based accelerators.
However, recent studies have shown that hardware manufacturing and
infrastructure contribute significantly to the carbon footprint of computing
devices, even surpassing the emissions generated during their use. For example,
the manufacturing process accounts for 74% of the total carbon emissions from
Apple in 2019. This prompts us to ask -- if we consider both the embodied
(manufacturing) and operational carbon cost of photonics, is it indeed a viable
avenue for a sustainable future? So, in this paper, we build a carbon footprint
model for photonic chips and investigate the sustainability of photonics-based
accelerators by conducting a case study on ADEPT, a photonics-based accelerator
for deep neural network inference. Our analysis shows that photonics can reduce
both operational and embodied carbon footprints with its high energy efficiency
and at least 4$\times$ less fabrication carbon cost per unit area than 28 nm

parameters of the Deep Neural Network (DNN) model to progressively learn to
perform new tasks without reducing the performance on previous tasks, i.e.,
avoiding the so-called catastrophic forgetting. However, the DNN parameter
update in CL-based autonomous systems is extremely resource-hungry. The
existing DNN accelerators cannot be directly employed in CL because they only
support the execution of the forward propagation. Only a few prior
architectures execute the backpropagation and weight update, but they lack the
control and management for CL. Towards this, we design a hardware architecture,
TinyCL, to perform CL on resource-constrained autonomous systems. It consists
of a processing unit that executes both forward and backward propagation, and a
control unit that manages memory-based CL workload. To minimize the memory
accesses, the sliding window of the convolutional layer moves in a snake-like
fashion. Moreover, the Multiply-and-Accumulate units can be reconfigured at
runtime to execute different operations. As per our knowledge, our proposed
TinyCL represents the first hardware accelerator that executes CL on autonomous
systems. We synthesize the complete TinyCL architecture in a 65 nm CMOS
technology node with the conventional ASIC design flow. It executes 1 epoch of
training on a Conv + ReLU + Dense model on the CIFAR10 dataset in 1.76 s, while
1 training epoch of the same model using an Nvidia Tesla P100 GPU takes 103 s,
thus achieving a 58 x speedup, consuming 86 mW in a 4.74 mm2 die.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09780v1'>2402.09780v1</a></div>

such as self-driving vehicles, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and security
robots. However, real-world deployment faces challenges due to their limited
computational resources and battery power. To tackle these challenges,
continuous learning exploits a lightweight "student" model at deployment
(inference), leverages a larger "teacher" model for labeling sampled data
(labeling), and continuously retrains the student model to adapt to changing
scenarios (retraining). This paper highlights the limitations in
state-of-the-art continuous learning systems: (1) they focus on computations
for retraining, while overlooking the compute needs for inference and labeling,
(2) they rely on power-hungry GPUs, unsuitable for battery-operated autonomous
systems, and (3) they are located on a remote centralized server, intended for
multi-tenant scenarios, again unsuitable for autonomous systems due to privacy,
network availability, and latency concerns. We propose a hardware-algorithm
co-designed solution for continuous learning, DaCapo, that enables autonomous
systems to perform concurrent executions of inference, labeling, and training
in a performant and energy-efficient manner. DaCapo comprises (1) a
spatially-partitionable and precision-flexible accelerator enabling parallel
execution of kernels on sub-accelerators at their respective precisions, and
(2) a spatiotemporal resource allocation algorithm that strategically navigates
the resource-accuracy tradeoff space, facilitating optimal decisions for
resource allocation to achieve maximal accuracy. Our evaluation shows that
DaCapo achieves 6.5% and 5.5% higher accuracy than a state-of-the-art GPU-based
continuous learning systems, Ekya and EOMU, respectively, while consuming 254x

While conventional ML compilers focus on code generation for CPUs, GPUs, and

reformulating the transformer models as RNN modules which modify the
self-attention computation with explicit states. However, these approaches
often incur significant performance degradation. The ultimate goal is to
develop a model that has the following properties: parallel training, streaming
and low-cost inference, and SOTA performance. In this paper, we propose a new
direction to achieve this goal. We show how architectural modifications to a

neuromorphic objects. At low latencies, the performance of existing SNNs is
drastically degraded. In this work, we propose the Shrinking SNN (SSNN) to
achieve low-latency neuromorphic object recognition without reducing
performance. Concretely, we alleviate the temporal redundancy in SNNs by
dividing SNNs into multiple stages with progressively shrinking timesteps,
which significantly reduces the inference latency. During timestep shrinkage,
the temporal transformer smoothly transforms the temporal scale and preserves
the information maximally. Moreover, we add multiple early classifiers to the
SNN during training to mitigate the mismatch between the surrogate gradient and
the true gradient, as well as the gradient vanishing/exploding, thus
eliminating the performance degradation at low latency. Extensive experiments

With only 5 average timesteps and without any data augmentation, SSNN is able

the introduction of interchange formats such as ONNX, which includes its

can be used across diverse DL frameworks and languages. Even though these

outperforms both PyTorch and TensorFlow for the computer vision models using
batch size 1, due to efficient GPU usage and thus low CPU usage. However, batch
size 64 makes PyTorch and MXNet practically indistinguishable, while TensorFlow
is outperformed consistently. For BERT, PyTorch exhibits the best performance.

decreased model accuracy or autonomy. To avoid these drawbacks, we divide DNN
into blocks and swap them in and out in order, such that large DNNs can execute

parameters compared to the CNN-based ones. To mitigate the computational
complexity, recently, a hybrid approach has been proposed, which uses ResNet as
a backbone architecture and replaces a part of its convolution layers with an
MHSA (Multi-Head Self-Attention) mechanism. In this paper, we significantly
reduce the parameter size of such models by using Neural ODE (Ordinary
Differential Equation) as a backbone architecture instead of ResNet. The
proposed hybrid model reduces the parameter size by 94.6% compared to the
CNN-based ones without degrading the accuracy. We then deploy the proposed
model on a modest-sized FPGA device for edge computing. To further reduce FPGA
resource utilization, we quantize the model following QAT (Quantization Aware

accuracy loss. As a result, an extremely lightweight Transformer-based model
can be implemented on resource-limited FPGAs. The weights of the feature
extraction network are stored on-chip to minimize the memory transfer overhead,

they were trained on. We address this challenge by introducing state-space
models (SSMs) with learnable timescale parameters to event-based vision. This
design adapts to varying frequencies without the need to retrain the network at
different frequencies. Additionally, we investigate two strategies to
counteract aliasing effects when deploying the model at higher frequencies. We
comprehensively evaluate our approach against existing methods based on RNN and
Transformer architectures across various benchmarks, including Gen1 and 1 Mpx
event camera datasets. Our results demonstrate that SSM-based models train 33%
faster and also exhibit minimal performance degradation when tested at higher
frequencies than the training input. Traditional RNN and Transformer models
exhibit performance drops of more than 20 mAP, with SSMs having a drop of 3.31
mAP, highlighting the effectiveness of SSMs in event-based vision tasks.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15584v1'>2402.15584v1</a></div>

pursuit of road segmentation methods. To this end, they have proposed many
lightweight networks. However, they ignore the fact that roads are "stuff"
(background or environmental elements) rather than "things" (specific
identifiable objects), which inspires us to explore the feasibility of
representing roads with low-level instead of high-level features. Surprisingly,
we find that the primary stage of mainstream network models is sufficient to
represent most pixels of the road for segmentation. Motivated by this, we
propose a Low-level Feature Dominated Road Segmentation network (LFD-RoadSeg).
Specifically, LFD-RoadSeg employs a bilateral structure. The spatial detail
branch is firstly designed to extract low-level feature representation for the
road by the first stage of ResNet-18. To suppress texture-less regions mistaken
as the road in the low-level feature, the context semantic branch is then
designed to extract the context feature in a fast manner. To this end, in the
second branch, we asymmetrically downsample the input image and design an
aggregation module to achieve comparable receptive fields to the third stage of
ResNet-18 but with less time consumption. Finally, to segment the road from the
low-level feature, a selective fusion module is proposed to calculate
pixel-wise attention between the low-level representation and context feature,
and suppress the non-road low-level response by this attention. On KITTI-Road,
LFD-RoadSeg achieves a maximum F1-measure (MaxF) of 95.21% and an average
precision of 93.71%, while reaching 238 FPS on a single TITAN Xp and 54 FPS on

necessitates smaller batch sizes to make training possible within the available
GPU memory budget, but in turn, results in substantially high and impractical
training time. We introduce NeuroFlux, a novel CNN training system tailored for

disrupts the typical layer dependencies under a new training paradigm -
$\textit{`adaptive local learning'}$. Moreover, NeuroFlux adeptly caches
intermediate activations, eliminating redundant forward passes over previously

partial solutions. Model parallelism, in particular, enables the distribution

computational demands. Instead of using the entire model for training, this

Memory Access Prediction (MAP), a critical task in mitigating memory latency
through data prefetching. However, existing DNN-based MAP models suffer from
the challenges such as significant physical storage space and poor inference
latency, primarily due to their large number of parameters. These limitations
render them impractical for deployment in real-world scenarios. In this paper,
we propose PaCKD, a Pattern-Clustered Knowledge Distillation approach to
compress MAP models while maintaining the prediction performance. The PaCKD
approach encompasses three steps: clustering memory access sequences into
distinct partitions involving similar patterns, training large pattern-specific
teacher models for memory access prediction for each partition, and training a
single lightweight student model by distilling the knowledge from the trained
pattern-specific teachers. We evaluate our approach on LSTM, MLP-Mixer, and
ResNet models, as they exhibit diverse structures and are widely used for image
classification tasks in order to test their effectiveness in four widely used
graph applications. Compared to the teacher models with 5.406M parameters and
an F1-score of 0.4626, our student models achieve a 552$\times$ model size
compression while maintaining an F1-score of 0.4538 (with a 1.92% performance

backpropagate (BP) end-to-end, which is not only biologically implausible but
also suffers from the update locking problem and requires huge memory
consumption. Local learning, which updates each layer independently with a
gradient-isolated auxiliary network, offers a promising alternative to address
the above problems. However, existing local learning methods are confronted
with a large accuracy gap with the BP counterpart, particularly for large-scale
networks. This is due to the weak coupling between local layers and their
subsequent network layers, as there is no gradient communication across layers.
To tackle this issue, we put forward an augmented local learning method, dubbed
AugLocal. AugLocal constructs each hidden layer's auxiliary network by
uniformly selecting a small subset of layers from its subsequent network layers
to enhance their synergy. We also propose to linearly reduce the depth of
auxiliary networks as the hidden layer goes deeper, ensuring sufficient network
capacity while reducing the computational cost of auxiliary networks. Our
extensive experiments on four image classification datasets (i.e., CIFAR-10,
SVHN, STL-10, and ImageNet) demonstrate that AugLocal can effectively scale up
to tens of local layers with a comparable accuracy to BP-trained networks while
reducing GPU memory usage by around 40%. The proposed AugLocal method,
therefore, opens up a myriad of opportunities for training high-performance
deep neural networks on resource-constrained platforms.Code is available at

long-range interactions, object-centric models are yet to fully embrace these
architectures. In particular, existing object-centric models for handling
sequential inputs, due to their reliance on RNN-based implementation, show poor
stability and capacity and are slow to train on long sequences. We introduce
Parallelizable Spatiotemporal Binder or PSB, the first
temporally-parallelizable slot learning architecture for sequential inputs.
Unlike conventional RNN-based approaches, PSB produces object-centric
representations, known as slots, for all time-steps in parallel. This is
achieved by refining the initial slots across all time-steps through a fixed
number of layers equipped with causal attention. By capitalizing on the
parallelism induced by our architecture, the proposed model exhibits a
significant boost in efficiency. In experiments, we test PSB extensively as an
encoder within an auto-encoding framework paired with a wide variety of decoder
options. Compared to the state-of-the-art, our architecture demonstrates stable
training on longer sequences, achieves parallelization that results in a 60%
increase in training speed, and yields performance that is on par with or
better on unsupervised 2D and 3D object-centric scene decomposition and

static appearances are less important in videos that contain motion

for video recognition, named Motion Coherent Augmentation (MCA), that
introduces appearance variation in videos and implicitly encourages the model

open-vocabulary action recognition. The CLIP model has achieved remarkable
success in a range of image-based tasks, benefiting from its strong
generalization capability stemming from pretaining on massive image-text pairs.
However, applying CLIP directly to the open-vocabulary action recognition task
is challenging due to the absence of temporal information in CLIP's
pretraining. Further, fine-tuning CLIP on action recognition datasets may lead
to overfitting and hinder its generalizability, resulting in unsatisfactory
results when dealing with unseen actions.
  To address these issues, FROSTER employs a residual feature distillation
approach to ensure that CLIP retains its generalization capability while
effectively adapting to the action recognition task. Specifically, the residual
feature distillation treats the frozen CLIP model as a teacher to maintain the
generalizability exhibited by the original CLIP and supervises the feature
learning for the extraction of video-specific features to bridge the gap
between images and videos. Meanwhile, it uses a residual sub-network for
feature distillation to reach a balance between the two distinct objectives of
learning generalizable and video-specific features.
  We extensively evaluate FROSTER on open-vocabulary action recognition
benchmarks under both base-to-novel and cross-dataset settings. FROSTER
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance on all datasets across the

However, they may not always strongly complement each other, they may also
exhibit weak complementary relationships, resulting in poor audio-visual

architecture. However, its modelling assumption that input signals and output
reconstructed frame share the same sparse representation neglects the
displacement caused by motion. To address this, we propose warping the input
intensity frames and sparse codes to enhance reconstruction quality. A
CISTA-Flow network is constructed by integrating a flow network with CISTA-LSTC

flow aids in reconstruction and then reconstructed frames are used to
facilitate flow estimation. We also introduce an iterative training framework

Traditionally, human experts analyze patterns in constellation diagrams to

their limited receptive fields, excel at extracting local features but struggle
to capture global relationships. To address this limitation, we introduce a
novel hybrid deep framework named TLDNN, which incorporates the architectures

all the following layers. We empirically demonstrate that this assumption is
often not correct, i.e., tokens that are redundant in one layer can be useful
in later layers. We employ this key insight to propose a novel token

comprehensively understand and analyze the nature of noise in pre-training

Specifically, through extensive experiments of fully-supervised and image-text
contrastive pre-training on synthetic noisy ImageNet-1K, YFCC15M, and CC12M
datasets, we demonstrate that, while slight noise in pre-training can benefit
in-domain (ID) performance, where the training and testing data share a similar

training and testing distributions are significantly different. These
observations are agnostic to scales of pre-training datasets, pre-training
noise types, model architectures, pre-training objectives, downstream tuning
methods, and downstream applications. We empirically ascertain that the reason
behind this is that the pre-training noise shapes the feature space
differently. We then propose a tuning method (NMTune) to affine the feature
space to mitigate the malignant effect of noise and improve generalization,
which is applicable in both parameter-efficient and black-box tuning manners.

Driven by the above, this work comprehensively investigates the safety

resilience to visual factor variations, calibrated uncertainty estimations, and
the ability to detect anomalous inputs. To this end, we study 83 CLIP models

is not perfect and can cause the model to hallucinate - provide answers that do

In this work, we find that the CLIP model possesses a rich set of features,

many downstream tasks, but they are utilized as frozen model without learning.
Prompt learning is a method to improve the pre-trained VLP model by adding a
learnable context vector to the inputs of the text encoder. In a few-shot
learning scenario of the downstream task, MLE training can lead the context
vector to over-fit dominant image features in the training data. This
overfitting can potentially harm the generalization ability, especially in the
presence of a distribution shift between the training and test dataset. This

alleviate the overfitting issues on few-shot learning application and increase

correlation evolvement between prompts and patch tokens during proficient

learned while tasks progress, the prompting selection strategy is itself
subject to catastrophic forgetting, an issue often overlooked by existing
approaches. For instance, prompts introduced to accommodate new tasks might end
up interfering with previously learned prompts. To make the selection strategy
more stable, we ask a foundational model (CLIP) to select our prompt within a

In this paper, we propose Proximal Reward Difference Prediction (PRDP),
enabling stable black-box reward finetuning for diffusion models for the first
time on large-scale prompt datasets with over 100K prompts. Our key innovation
is the Reward Difference Prediction (RDP) objective that has the same optimal

Specifically, the RDP objective is a supervised regression objective that tasks
the diffusion model with predicting the reward difference of generated image
pairs from their denoising trajectories. We theoretically prove that the
diffusion model that obtains perfect reward difference prediction is exactly
the maximizer of the RL objective. We further develop an online algorithm with
proximal updates to stably optimize the RDP objective. In experiments, we

generalization in vision-language tasks after visual instruction tuning.
However, bridging the gap between the pre-trained vision encoder and the large
language models becomes the whole network's bottleneck. To improve
cross-modality alignment, existing works usually consider more visual
instruction data covering a broader range of vision tasks to fine-tune the
model for question-answering, which are costly to obtain. However, the image
contains rich contextual information that has been largely under-explored. This
paper first attempts to harness this overlooked context within visual
instruction data, training the model to self-supervised `learning' how to ask
high-quality questions. In this way, we introduce a novel framework named
SQ-LLaVA: Self-Questioning for Large Vision-Language Assistant. SQ-LLaVA
exhibits proficiency in generating flexible and meaningful image-related
questions while analyzing the visual clue and prior language knowledge,
signifying an advanced level of generalized visual understanding. Moreover,
fine-tuning SQ-LLaVA on higher-quality instruction data shows a consistent
performance improvement compared with traditional visual-instruction tuning
methods. This improvement highlights the efficacy of self-questioning
techniques in achieving a deeper and more nuanced comprehension of visual

scale. There are two major limitations of previous video-language alignment
approaches. First, they do not capture both short-range and long-range temporal
dependencies and typically employ complex hierarchical deep network
architectures that are hard to integrate with existing pretrained image-text
foundation models. To effectively address this limitation, we instead keep the
network architecture simple and use a set of data tokens that operate at
different temporal resolutions in a hierarchical manner, accounting for the
temporally hierarchical nature of videos. By employing a simple two-tower
architecture, we are able to initialize our video-language model with
pretrained image-text foundation models, thereby boosting the final
performance. Second, existing video-language alignment works struggle due to
the lack of semantically aligned large-scale training data. To overcome it, we
leverage recent LLMs to curate the largest video-language dataset to date with
better visual grounding. Furthermore, unlike existing video-text datasets which
only contain short clips, our dataset is enriched with video clips of varying

Therefore, we propose a Multi-modal Anticipative Transformer (MAT), an

the model first learns to predict actions in the video clip by aligning with

substantial knowledge from pre-training on web-level corpora. However, the
performance of MLLMs declines with an increase in category numbers, primarily
due to growing complexity and constraints of limited context window size. To
synergize the strengths of both approaches and enhance the few-shot/zero-shot

presumably due to their limited presence in the pretraining data. However,
measuring the frequency of concepts in VLMs' large-scale datasets is
challenging. We address this by using large language models (LLMs) to count the
number of pretraining texts that contain synonyms of these concepts. Our
analysis confirms that popular datasets, such as LAION, exhibit a long-tailed
concept distribution, yielding biased performance in VLMs. We also find that
downstream applications of VLMs, including visual chatbots (e.g., GPT-4V) and
text-to-image models (e.g., Stable Diffusion), often fail to recognize or
generate images of rare concepts identified by our method. To mitigate the
imbalanced performance of zero-shot VLMs, we propose REtrieval-Augmented

names, REAL uses their most frequent synonyms found in pretraining texts. This
simple change already outperforms costly human-engineered and LLM-enriched
prompts over nine benchmark datasets. Second, REAL trains a linear classifier

increasingly used for various real-world tasks. Prior work has shown that these
models are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks on the vision modality.
These attacks can be leveraged to spread fake information or defraud users, and
thus pose a significant risk, which makes the robustness of large multi-modal
foundation models a pressing problem. The CLIP model, or one of its variants,
is used as a frozen vision encoder in many vision-language models (VLMs), e.g.
LLaVA and OpenFlamingo. We propose an unsupervised adversarial fine-tuning
scheme to obtain a robust CLIP vision encoder, which yields robustness on all
vision down-stream tasks (VLMs, zero-shot classification) that rely on CLIP. In
particular, we show that stealth-attacks on users of VLMs by a malicious third
party providing manipulated images are no longer possible once one replaces the
original CLIP model with our robust one. No retraining or fine-tuning of the
VLM is required. The code and robust models are available at

realized on standard deep learning hardware. In this work, we focus on
structured pruning in the one-shot (post-training) setting, which does not
require model retraining after pruning. We propose a novel combinatorial
optimization framework for this problem, based on a layer-wise reconstruction
objective and a careful reformulation that allows for scalable optimization.
Moreover, we design a new local combinatorial optimization algorithm, which
exploits low-rank updates for efficient local search. Our framework is time and
memory-efficient and considerably improves upon state-of-the-art one-shot
methods on vision models (e.g., ResNet50, MobileNet) and language models (e.g.,
OPT-1.3B -- OPT-30B). For language models, e.g., OPT-2.7B, OSSCAR can lead to
$125\times$ lower test perplexity on WikiText with $2\times$ inference time
speedup in comparison to the state-of-the-art ZipLM approach. Our framework is

However, the susceptibility of recent Large Vision-Language Models to these

against CLIP randomly sample a misleading class from a predefined set of
categories. However, this simple strategy misses more effective attacks that
exploit LVLM(s) stronger language skills. To address these issues, we first
introduce a benchmark for testing Typographic attacks against LVLM(s).
Moreover, we introduce two novel and more effective \textit{Self-Generated}

Based Attack where the LVLM (e.g. LLaVA) is asked which deceiving class is most
similar to the target class and 2) Descriptive Attacks where a more advanced
LVLM (e.g. GPT4-V) is asked to recommend a Typographic attack that includes
both a deceiving class and description. Using our benchmark, we uncover that
Self-Generated attacks pose a significant threat, reducing LVLM(s)
classification performance by up to 33\%. We also uncover that attacks
generated by one model (e.g. GPT-4V or LLaVA) are effective against the model
itself and other models like InstructBLIP and MiniGPT4. Code:

attacks that can manipulate responses to innocuous, everyday prompts. We
introduce Shadowcast, a stealthy data poisoning attack method where poison

Shadowcast demonstrates effectiveness in two attack types. The first is Label
Attack, tricking VLMs into misidentifying class labels, such as confusing
Donald Trump for Joe Biden. The second is Persuasion Attack, which leverages
VLMs' text generation capabilities to craft narratives, such as portraying junk
food as health food, through persuasive and seemingly rational descriptions. We
show that Shadowcast are highly effective in achieving attacker's intentions
using as few as 50 poison samples. Moreover, these poison samples remain
effective across various prompts and are transferable across different VLM
architectures in the black-box setting. This work reveals how poisoned VLMs can
generate convincing yet deceptive misinformation and underscores the importance

transparency, which triggers AI misinterpretation of what the human eye
perceives. The research compiles a broad attack surface to investigate the
consequences ranging from traditional watermarking, steganography, and
background-foreground miscues. We demonstrate dataset poisoning using the
attack to mislabel a collection of grayscale landscapes and logos using either
a single attack layer or randomly selected poisoning classes. For example, a
military tank to the human eye is a mislabeled bridge to object classifiers
based on convolutional networks (YOLO, etc.) and vision transformers (ViT,
GPT-Vision, etc.). A notable attack limitation stems from its dependency on the
background (hidden) layer in grayscale as a rough match to the transparent
foreground image that the human eye perceives. This dependency limits the
practical success rate without manual tuning and exposes the hidden layers when
placed on the opposite display theme (e.g., light background, light transparent
foreground visible, works best against a light theme image viewer or browser).
The stealth transparency confounds established vision systems, including
evading facial recognition and surveillance, digital watermarking, content
filtering, dataset curating, automotive and drone autonomy, forensic evidence

traditional adversarial attacks that typically focus on modifying pixel values

trustworthy artificial intelligence. In this regard, a promising paradigm
considers embedding task-required invariant structures, e.g., geometric
invariance, in the fundamental image representation. However, such invariant
representations typically exhibit limited discriminability, limiting their
applications in larger-scale trustworthy vision tasks. For this open problem,
we conduct a systematic investigation of hierarchical invariance, exploring
this topic from theoretical, practical, and application perspectives. At the
theoretical level, we show how to construct over-complete invariants with a
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)-like hierarchical architecture yet in a
fully interpretable manner. The general blueprint, specific definitions,
invariant properties, and numerical implementations are provided. At the
practical level, we discuss how to customize this theoretical framework into a
given task. With the over-completeness, discriminative features w.r.t. the task
can be adaptively formed in a Neural Architecture Search (NAS)-like manner. We
demonstrate the above arguments with accuracy, invariance, and efficiency
results on texture, digit, and parasite classification experiments.
Furthermore, at the application level, our representations are explored in
real-world forensics tasks on adversarial perturbations and Artificial
Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC). Such applications reveal that the
proposed strategy not only realizes the theoretically promised invariance, but
also exhibits competitive discriminability even in the era of deep learning.
For robust and interpretable vision tasks at larger scales, hierarchical
invariant representation can be considered as an effective alternative to
traditional CNN and invariants.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15430v1'>2402.15430v1</a></div>

subsequent predictions but also enables seamless integration with current
advancements in prompt engineering. At test-time, TPS dynamically learns shift
vectors for each prototype based solely on the given test sample, effectively
bridging the domain gap and enhancing classification accuracy. A notable aspect
of our framework is its significantly reduced memory and computational demands

improve the assessment of coarse answers on fine-grained classification tasks,
we suggest using the semantic hierarchy of the label space to ask automatically

compare traditional NLP and LLM-based metrics for the problem of evaluating
model predictions given ground-truth answers. We perform a human evaluation
study upon which we base our decision on the final metric. We apply our

performance of vision-language models (VLMs) on various vision-language (VL)

For example, VLMs can be given a "visual prompt", where visual markers such as
bounding boxes delineate key image regions. However, current VLMs that can
incorporate visual guidance are either proprietary and expensive or require
costly training on curated data that includes visual prompts. We introduce
Contrastive Region Guidance (CRG), a training-free guidance method that enables
open-source VLMs to respond to visual prompts. CRG contrasts model outputs
produced with and without visual prompts, factoring out biases revealed by the
model when answering without the information required to produce a correct
answer (i.e., the model's prior). CRG achieves substantial improvements in a
wide variety of VL tasks: When region annotations are provided, CRG increases
absolute accuracy by up to 11.1% on ViP-Bench, a collection of six diverse
region-based tasks such as recognition, math, and object relationship
reasoning. We also show CRG's applicability to spatial reasoning, with 10%
improvement on What'sUp, as well as to compositional generalization --
improving accuracy by 11.5% and 7.5% on two challenging splits from SugarCrepe
-- and to image-text alignment for generated images, where we improve by up to
8.4 AUROC and 6.8 F1 points on SeeTRUE. When reference regions are absent, CRG
allows us to re-rank proposed regions in referring expression comprehension and
phrase grounding benchmarks like RefCOCO/+/g and Flickr30K Entities, with an
average gain of 3.2% in accuracy. Our analysis explores alternative masking
strategies for CRG, quantifies CRG's probability shift, and evaluates the role
of region guidance strength, empirically validating CRG's design choices.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02325v1'>2403.02325v1</a></div>

However, VLMs produce only textual outputs, while robotic control and other
spatial tasks require outputting continuous coordinates, actions, or
trajectories. How can we enable VLMs to handle such settings without
fine-tuning on task-specific data?
  In this paper, we propose a novel visual prompting approach for VLMs that we
call Prompting with Iterative Visual Optimization (PIVOT), which casts tasks as
iterative visual question answering. In each iteration, the image is annotated
with a visual representation of proposals that the VLM can refer to (e.g.,
candidate robot actions, localizations, or trajectories). The VLM then selects
the best ones for the task. These proposals are iteratively refined, allowing
the VLM to eventually zero in on the best available answer. We investigate
PIVOT on real-world robotic navigation, real-world manipulation from images,
instruction following in simulation, and additional spatial inference tasks
such as localization. We find, perhaps surprisingly, that our approach enables
zero-shot control of robotic systems without any robot training data,
navigation in a variety of environments, and other capabilities. Although
current performance is far from perfect, our work highlights potentials and
limitations of this new regime and shows a promising approach for

billions of model parameters and training examples. However, even the largest
models struggle with compositional reasoning, generalization, fine-grained
spatial and temporal reasoning, and counting. Visual reasoning with large
language models (LLMs) as controllers can, in principle, address these
limitations by decomposing the task and solving subtasks by orchestrating a set
of (visual) tools. Recently, these models achieved great performance on tasks
such as compositional visual question answering, visual grounding, and video
temporal reasoning. Nevertheless, in their current form, these models heavily
rely on human engineering of in-context examples in the prompt, which are often
dataset- and task-specific and require significant labor by highly skilled
programmers. In this work, we present a framework that mitigates these issues
by introducing spatially and temporally abstract routines and by leveraging a
small number of labeled examples to automatically generate in-context examples,
thereby avoiding human-created in-context examples. On a number of visual
reasoning tasks, we show that our framework leads to consistent gains in
performance, makes LLMs as controllers setup more robust, and removes the need
for human engineering of in-context examples.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01974v1'>2401.01974v1</a></div>

the investigation into the visual domain, we developed a function learning
paradigm to explore the capacity of humans and neural network models in

four main interaction types, including instances in which the application of
the first function creates or removes the context for applying the second

handling a variety of visual-language tasks. However, current MLLM benchmarks
are predominantly designed to evaluate reasoning based on static information

sequences, which is essential for understanding our ever-changing world, has
been less investigated. To address this challenge, this paper introduces
Mementos, a new benchmark designed to assess MLLMs' sequential image reasoning

dynamic information about given image sequences, often leading to
hallucinations/misrepresentations of objects and their corresponding behaviors.
Our quantitative analysis and case studies identify three key factors impacting
MLLMs' sequential image reasoning: the correlation between object and

The model, FlexCap, is trained to produce length-conditioned captions for input

output, with descriptions ranging from concise object labels to detailed
captions. To achieve this we create large-scale training datasets of image
region descriptions of varying length, starting from captioned images. This
flexible-captioning capability has several valuable applications.
  First, FlexCap demonstrates superior performance in dense captioning tasks on
the Visual Genome dataset. Second, a visual question answering (VQA) system can
be built by employing FlexCap to generate localized descriptions as inputs to a
large language model. The resulting system achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot

ability to extract diverse visual information through prefix conditioning.
Finally, we qualitatively demonstrate FlexCap's broad applicability in tasks
such as image labeling, object attribute recognition, and visual dialog.

for any downstream tasks for better longer range prediction. To this end,

System-Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) is a novel method applied in
safety-related fields like defense and aerospace, which is also becoming
popular in the automotive industry. However, STPA assumes prerequisites that
are not fully valid in the automotive system engineering with distributed
system development and multi-abstraction design levels. This would inhibit
software developers from using STPA to analyze their software as part of a

comprehensive study of routers in MoEs for computer vision tasks. We introduce
a unified MoE formulation that subsumes different MoEs with two parametric

refers to the phenomenon that the LVLMs claim non-existent objects in the

model-based detection methods have been proposed, which either require
large-scare computational resources or depend on the detection result of
external models. However, there remains an under-explored field to utilize the
LVLM itself to alleviate object hallucinations. In this work, we adopt the
intuition that the LVLM tends to respond logically consistently for existent

Logical Closed Loop-based framework for Object Hallucination Detection and
Mitigation, namely LogicCheckGPT. In specific, we devise logical consistency
probing to raise questions with logical correlations, inquiring about

applications from zero-shot image classification, over to image captioning, and
visual question answering. Unlike pure vision models, they offer an intuitive
way to access visual content through language prompting. The wide applicability
of such models encourages us to ask whether they also align with human vision -
specifically, how far they adopt human-induced visual biases through multimodal
fusion, or whether they simply inherit biases from pure vision models. One
important visual bias is the texture vs. shape bias, or the dominance of local
over global information. In this paper, we study this bias in a wide range of
popular VLMs. Interestingly, we find that VLMs are often more shape-biased than
their vision encoders, indicating that visual biases are modulated to some
extent through text in multimodal models. If text does indeed influence visual
biases, this suggests that we may be able to steer visual biases not just
through visual input but also through language: a hypothesis that we confirm
through extensive experiments. For instance, we are able to steer shape bias
from as low as 49% to as high as 72% through prompting alone. For now, the
strong human bias towards shape (96%) remains out of reach for all tested VLMs.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09193v1'>2403.09193v1</a></div>

impressive capability in visual information understanding with human language.
Despite these advances, LVLMs still face challenges with multimodal
hallucination, such as generating text descriptions of objects that are not
present in the visual information. However, the underlying fundamental reasons
of multimodal hallucinations remain poorly explored. In this paper, we propose
a new perspective, suggesting that the inherent biases in LVLMs might be a key
factor in hallucinations. Specifically, we systematically identify a semantic
shift bias related to paragraph breaks (\n\n), where the content before and
after '\n\n' in the training data frequently exhibit significant semantic
changes. This pattern leads the model to infer that the contents following
'\n\n' should be obviously different from the preceding contents with less
hallucinatory descriptions, thereby increasing the probability of hallucinatory
descriptions subsequent to the '\n\n'. We have validated this hypothesis on
multiple publicly available LVLMs. Besides, we find that deliberately inserting
'\n\n' at the generated description can induce more hallucinations. A simple
method is proposed to effectively mitigate the hallucination of LVLMs by
skipping the output of '\n'.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01345v4'>2402.01345v4</a></div>

dissect LVLM-related hallucinations in an attempt to establish an overview and
facilitate future mitigation. Our scrutiny starts with a clarification of the
concept of hallucinations in LVLMs, presenting a variety of hallucination

hallucinations, an issue in which their generated text contains non-existent
objects, greatly limiting their reliability and practicality. Current
approaches often rely on the model's token likelihoods or other internal
information, instruction tuning on additional datasets, or incorporating
complex external tools. We first perform empirical analysis on sentence-level
LVLM hallucination, finding that CLIP similarity to the image acts as a
stronger and more robust indicator of hallucination compared to token
likelihoods. Motivated by this, we introduce our CLIP-Guided Decoding (CGD)
approach, a straightforward but effective training-free approach to reduce
object hallucination at decoding time. CGD uses CLIP to guide the model's
decoding process by enhancing visual grounding of generated text with the
image. Experiments demonstrate that CGD effectively mitigates object
hallucination across multiple LVLM families while preserving the utility of
text generation.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15300v1'>2402.15300v1</a></div>

designed to mitigate OH in LVLMs. HALC leverages distinct fine-grained optimal
visual information in vision-language tasks and operates on both local and
global contexts simultaneously. Specifically, HALC integrates a robust
auto-focal grounding mechanism (locally) to correct hallucinated tokens on the
fly, and a specialized beam search algorithm (globally) to significantly reduce
OH while preserving text generation quality. Additionally, HALC can be
integrated into any LVLMs as a plug-and-play module without extra training.
Extensive experimental studies demonstrate the effectiveness of HALC in
reducing OH, outperforming state-of-the-arts across four benchmarks.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00425v1'>2403.00425v1</a></div>
