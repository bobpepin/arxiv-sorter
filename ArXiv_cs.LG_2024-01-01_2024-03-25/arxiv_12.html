(MARL) problems using Reward Machines (RMs) to specify the reward functions
such that the prior knowledge of high-level events in a task can be leveraged
to facilitate the learning efficiency. Unlike the existing work that RMs have
been incorporated into MARL for task decomposition and policy learning in
relatively simple domains or with an assumption of independencies among the
agents, we present Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with a Hierarchy of RMs
(MAHRM) that is capable of dealing with more complex scenarios when the events
among agents can occur concurrently and the agents are highly interdependent.
  MAHRM exploits the relationship of high-level events to decompose a task into
a hierarchy of simpler subtasks that are assigned to a small group of agents,
so as to reduce the overall computational complexity.
  Experimental results in three cooperative MARL domains show that MAHRM
outperforms other MARL methods using the same prior knowledge of high-level
events.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07005v1'>2403.07005v1</a></div>

multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) in complex coordination tasks.
Existing methods mainly utilize intrinsic rewards to enable committed
exploration or use role-based learning for decomposing joint action spaces
instead of directly conducting a collective search in the entire
action-observation space. However, they often face challenges obtaining
specific joint action sequences to reach successful states in long-horizon
tasks. To address this limitation, we propose Imagine, Initialize, and Explore
(IIE), a novel method that offers a promising solution for efficient
multi-agent exploration in complex scenarios. IIE employs a transformer model
to imagine how the agents reach a critical state that can influence each
other's transition functions. Then, we initialize the environment at this state
using a simulator before the exploration phase. We formulate the imagination as
a sequence modeling problem, where the states, observations, prompts, actions,
and rewards are predicted autoregressively. The prompt consists of
timestep-to-go, return-to-go, influence value, and one-shot demonstration,
specifying the desired state and trajectory as well as guiding the action
generation. By initializing agents at the critical states, IIE significantly
increases the likelihood of discovering potentially important under-explored
regions. Despite its simplicity, empirical results demonstrate that our method
outperforms multi-agent exploration baselines on the StarCraft Multi-Agent
Challenge (SMAC) and SMACv2 environments. Particularly, IIE shows improved
performance in the sparse-reward SMAC tasks and produces more effective
curricula over the initialized states than other generative methods, such as
CVAE-GAN and diffusion models.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17978v2'>2402.17978v2</a></div>

vast application prospects, including swarm control of drones, collaborative

security threats during the MARL deployment need more attention and thorough
investigation. Recent researches reveal that an attacker can rapidly exploit
the victim's vulnerabilities and generate adversarial policies, leading to the
victim's failure in specific tasks. For example, reducing the winning rate of a
superhuman-level Go AI to around 20%. They predominantly focus on two-player
competitive environments, assuming attackers possess complete global state

  In this study, we unveil, for the first time, the capability of attackers to
generate adversarial policies even when restricted to partial observations of
the victims in multi-agent competitive environments. Specifically, we propose a
novel black-box attack (SUB-PLAY), which incorporates the concept of
constructing multiple subgames to mitigate the impact of partial observability
and suggests the sharing of transitions among subpolicies to improve the
exploitative ability of attackers. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the
effectiveness of SUB-PLAY under three typical partial observability
limitations. Visualization results indicate that adversarial policies induce
significantly different activations of the victims' policy networks.
Furthermore, we evaluate three potential defenses aimed at exploring ways to
mitigate security threats posed by adversarial policies, providing constructive

In the auxiliary phase, agents with poor performance diversified via

extraction of informative states through graph neural networks. Second, we
reformulate the construction process of TTR's solution, not only decoupling the
decision model from the problem size but also ensuring the generated scheme's

is proposed to assist the learned decision model, which can significantly
improve solution quality with little additional computation cost, further
enhancing the practical value of our method. Extensive experimental results

Life-cycle management of such engineering systems is a computationally
intensive task, requiring appropriate sequential inspection and maintenance
decisions able to reduce long-term risks and costs, while dealing with
different uncertainties and constraints that lie in high-dimensional spaces. To
date, static age- or condition-based maintenance methods and risk-based or
periodic inspection plans have mostly addressed this class of optimization
problems. However, optimality, scalability, and uncertainty limitations are
often manifested under such approaches. The optimization problem in this work
is cast in the framework of constrained Partially Observable Markov Decision
Processes (POMDPs), which provides a comprehensive mathematical basis for
stochastic sequential decision settings with observation uncertainties, risk
considerations, and limited resources. To address significantly large state and
action spaces, a Deep Decentralized Multi-agent Actor-Critic (DDMAC) DRL method
with Centralized Training and Decentralized Execution (CTDE), termed as
DDMAC-CTDE is developed. The performance strengths of the DDMAC-CTDE method are
demonstrated in a generally representative and realistic example application of
an existing transportation network in Virginia, USA. The network includes
several bridge and pavement components with nonstationary degradation,
agency-imposed constraints, and traffic delay and risk considerations. Compared
to traditional management policies for transportation networks, the proposed
DDMAC-CTDE method vastly outperforms its counterparts. Overall, the proposed
algorithmic framework provides near optimal solutions for transportation
infrastructure management under real-world constraints and complexities.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12455v1'>2401.12455v1</a></div>

relationship between acquiring robustness and regularizing entropy has been
identified. Additionally, imitation learning is used within this framework to
reflect experts' behavior. However, there are no comprehensive studies on the
use of a similar imitation framework for optimal transport on networks.
Therefore, in this study, imitation-regularized optimal transport (I-OT) on

imitating a given prior distribution. The I-OT solution demonstrated robustness
in terms of the cost defined on the network. Moreover, we applied the I-OT to a

conceptualized as an optimization problem, where an algorithm interacts with an
unknown environment to minimize cumulative regret. In a stationary setting,
strong theoretical guarantees, like a sublinear ($\sqrt{T}$) regret bound, can
be obtained, which typically implies the convergence to an optimal policy and
the cessation of exploration. However, these theoretical setups often
oversimplify the complexities encountered in real-world RL implementations,
where tasks arrive sequentially with substantial changes between tasks and the
algorithm may not be allowed to adaptively learn within certain tasks. We study
the changes beyond the outcome distributions, encompassing changes in the
reward designs (mappings from outcomes to rewards) and the permissible policy
spaces. Our results reveal the fallacy of myopically minimizing regret within
each task: obtaining optimal regret rates in the early tasks may lead to worse
rates in the subsequent ones, even when the outcome distributions stay the

algorithm has to overly explore in the earlier tasks. This theoretical insight
is practically significant, suggesting that due to unanticipated changes (e.g.,
rapid technological development or human-in-the-loop involvement) between

stationary setting within each task. Such implication resonates with the common

applications in cloud computing and crowdsourcing. Optimal scheduling can
enhance system performance, typically measured by the reward-to-cost ratio,
under some task arrival distribution. On one hand, both reward and cost are
dependent on task context (e.g., evaluation metric) and remain black-box in
practice. These render reward and cost hard to model thus unknown before
decision making. On the other hand, task arrival behaviors remain sensitive to
factors like unpredictable system fluctuation whereby a prior estimation or the
conventional assumption of arrival distribution (e.g., Poisson) may fail. This
implies another practical yet often neglected challenge, i.e., uncertain task
arrival distribution. Towards effective scheduling under a stationary
environment with various uncertainties, we propose a double-optimistic learning
based Robbins-Monro (DOL-RM) algorithm. Specifically, DOL-RM integrates a
learning module that incorporates optimistic estimation for reward-to-cost
ratio and a decision module that utilizes the Robbins-Monro method to
implicitly learn task arrival distribution while making scheduling decisions.
Theoretically, DOL-RM achieves convergence gap and no regret learning with a
sub-linear regret of $O(T^{3/4})$, which is the first result for online task
scheduling under uncertain task arrival distribution and unknown reward and

couriers and customer orders. We consider two types of crowdsourced couriers,
namely, committed and occasional couriers, each with different compensation
schemes. Crowdsourced delivery platforms usually schedule committed courier
shifts based on predicted demand. Therefore, platforms may devise an offline
schedule for committed couriers before the planning period. However, due to the
unpredictability of demand, there are instances where it becomes necessary to
make online adjustments to the offline schedule. In this study, we focus on the
problem of dynamically adjusting the offline schedule through shift extensions
for committed couriers. This problem is modeled as a sequential decision
process. The objective is to maximize platform profit by determining the shift
extensions of couriers and the assignments of requests to couriers. To solve
the model, a Deep Q-Network (DQN) learning approach is developed. Comparing
this model with the baseline policy where no extensions are allowed
demonstrates the benefits that platforms can gain from allowing shift
extensions in terms of reward, reduced lost order costs, and lost requests.
Additionally, sensitivity analysis showed that the total extension compensation
increases in a nonlinear manner with the arrival rate of requests, and in a
linear manner with the arrival rate of occasional couriers. On the compensation
sensitivity, the results showed that the normal scenario exhibited the highest
average number of shift extensions and, consequently, the fewest average number
of lost requests. These findings serve as evidence of the successful learning
of such dynamics by the DQN algorithm.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09961v1'>2402.09961v1</a></div>

with limited observations. To make decisions from such limited observations, it
is necessary to find an appropriate distribution for exploration. Recently, a
powerful approach for this purpose, exploration by optimization (ExO), was
proposed, which achieves the optimal bounds in adversarial environments with
follow-the-regularized-leader for a wide range of online decision-making
problems. However, a naive application of ExO in stochastic environments
significantly degrades regret bounds. To resolve this problem in locally
observable games, we first establish a novel framework and analysis for ExO
with a hybrid regularizer. This development allows us to significantly improve
the existing regret bounds of best-of-both-worlds (BOBW) algorithms, which
achieves nearly optimal bounds both in stochastic and adversarial environments.
In particular, we derive a stochastic regret bound of $O(\sum_{a \neq a^*} k^2
m^2 \log T / \Delta_a)$, where $k$, $m$, and $T$ are the numbers of actions,
observations and rounds, $a^*$ is an optimal action, and $\Delta_a$ is the
suboptimality gap for action $a$. This bound is roughly $\Theta(k^2 \log T)$
times smaller than existing BOBW bounds. In addition, for globally observable
games, we provide a new BOBW algorithm with the first $O(\log T)$ stochastic
bound.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08321v1'>2402.08321v1</a></div>

leader commits to a (mixed) strategy, and a follower best-responds. Stackelberg
games are perhaps one of the biggest success stories of algorithmic game theory
over the last decade, as algorithms for playing in Stackelberg games have been
deployed in many real-world domains including airport security, anti-poaching
efforts, and cyber-crime prevention. However, these algorithms often fail to
take into consideration the additional information available to each player
(e.g. traffic patterns, weather conditions, network congestion), a salient
feature of reality which may significantly affect both players' optimal
strategies. We formalize such settings as Stackelberg games with side
information, in which both players observe an external context before playing.
The leader then commits to a (possibly context-dependent) strategy, and the
follower best-responds to both the leader's strategy and the context. We focus
on the online setting in which a sequence of followers arrive over time, and
the context may change from round-to-round. In sharp contrast to the
non-contextual version, we show that it is impossible for the leader to achieve
good performance (measured by regret) in the full adversarial setting (i.e.,
when both the context and the follower are chosen by an adversary). However, it
turns out that a little bit of randomness goes a long way. Motivated by our
impossibility result, we show that no-regret learning is possible in two
natural relaxations: the setting in which the sequence of followers is chosen
stochastically and the sequence of contexts is adversarial, and the setting in
which the sequence of contexts is stochastic and the sequence of followers is
chosen by an adversary.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08576v2'>2402.08576v2</a></div>

methods often compromise performance in the absence of attacks or the presence
of only weak attacks. To address this, we study policy robustness under the
well-accepted state-adversarial attack model, extending our focus beyond only
worst-case attacks. We first formalize this task at test time as a regret
minimization problem and establish its intrinsic hardness in achieving
sublinear regret when the baseline policy is from a general continuous policy
class, $\Pi$. This finding prompts us to \textit{refine} the baseline policy
class $\Pi$ prior to test time, aiming for efficient adaptation within a finite
policy class $\Tilde{\Pi}$, which can resort to an adversarial bandit
subroutine. In light of the importance of a small, finite $\Tilde{\Pi}$, we

\textit{non-dominated policies}, forming a near-optimal and minimal

that any attack strategy merely provides a potential paradigm of
disintegration. The key concern is: in the worst-case scenario or facing the
most severe attacks, what is the limit of robustness, referred to as ``Worst
Robustness'', for a given system? Understanding a system's worst robustness is
imperative for grasping its reliability limits, accurately evaluating
protective capabilities, and determining associated design and security
maintenance costs. To address these challenges, we introduce the concept of
Most Destruction Attack (MDA) based on the idea of knowledge stacking. MDA is
employed to assess the worst robustness of networks, followed by the
application of an adapted CNN algorithm for rapid worst robustness prediction.

shift, where training and deployment conditions for a machine learning model

performance, much attention has been devoted to algorithmic interventions that
mitigate these detrimental effects. In this paper, we study the effect of
distribution shift in the presence of model misspecification, specifically
focusing on $L_{\infty}$-misspecified regression and adversarial covariate
shift, where the regression target remains fixed while the covariate
distribution changes arbitrarily. We show that empirical risk minimization, or
standard least squares regression, can result in undesirable misspecification
amplification where the error due to misspecification is amplified by the
density ratio between the training and testing distributions. As our main
result, we develop a new algorithm -- inspired by robust optimization
techniques -- that avoids this undesirable behavior, resulting in no
misspecification amplification while still obtaining optimal statistical rates.
As applications, we use this regression procedure to obtain new guarantees in

additionally, we adopt the pessimistic principle to address the distributional

that, by incorporating auxiliary variables that mediate the effect of actions

describing an instance as input. Input data can take the form of features
derived from the instance description or fitness landscape, or can be a direct
representation of the instance itself, i.e. an image or textual description.
Regardless of the choice of input, there is an implicit assumption that
instances that are similar will elicit similar performance from algorithm, and
that a model is capable of learning this relationship. We argue that viewing
algorithm-selection purely from an instance perspective can be misleading as it
fails to account for how an algorithm `views' similarity between instances. We
propose a novel `algorithm-centric' method for describing instances that can be
used to train models for algorithm-selection: specifically, we use short
probing trajectories calculated by applying a solver to an instance for a very
short period of time. The approach is demonstrated to be promising, providing
comparable or better results to computationally expensive landscape-based
feature-based approaches. Furthermore, projecting the trajectories into a
2-dimensional space illustrates that functions that are similar from an

the system to interact with non-expert users. Robot imitation frameworks aim to
simplify and reduce times of robot programming by allowing users to program
directly through demonstrations. In classical frameworks, actions are modeled
using joint or Cartesian space trajectories. Other features, such as visual
ones, are not always well represented with these pure geometrical approaches.
Continuous Goal-Directed Actions (CGDA) is an alternative to these methods, as
it encodes actions as changes of any feature that can be extracted from the
environment. As a consequence of this, the robot joint trajectories for
execution must be fully computed to comply with this feature-agnostic encoding.
This is achieved using Evolutionary Algorithms (EA), which usually requires too
many evaluations to perform this evolution step in the actual robot. Current
strategies involve performing evaluations in a simulation, transferring the
final joint trajectory to the actual robot. Smart City applications involve
working in highly dynamic and complex environments, where having a precise
model is not always achievable. Our goal is to study the tractability of
performing these evaluations directly in a real-world scenario. Two different
approaches to reduce the number of evaluations using EA, are proposed and
compared. In the first approach, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)-based
methods have been studied and compared within CGDA: naive PSO, Fitness
Inheritance PSO (FI-PSO), and Adaptive Fuzzy Fitness Granulation with PSO
(AFFG-PSO). The second approach studied the introduction of geometrical and
velocity constraints within CGDA. The effects of both approaches were analyzed
and compared in the wax and paint actions, two CGDA commonly studied use cases.

$\mathbf{x}$ arises in a myriad of scientific applications. In such

$f(\mathbf{x},\boldsymbol{\theta})$, where $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ are parameters
that are uncertain in practice. Robust optimization aims to optimize the
objective $\mathbb{E}[f(\mathbf{x},\boldsymbol{\Theta})]$, where
$\boldsymbol{\Theta} \sim \mathcal{P}$ is a random variable that models
uncertainty on $\boldsymbol{\theta}$. For this, existing black-box methods
typically employ a two-stage approach for selecting the next point
$(\mathbf{x},\boldsymbol{\theta})$, where $\mathbf{x}$ and

surrogate on $f$, the TVR acquisition can be evaluated in closed form, and
reveals an insightful exploration-exploitation-precision trade-off for robust

for Maxent models, however, were not originally designed to handle big data
sets; these algorithms either rely on technical devices that may yield
unreliable numerical results, scale poorly, or require smoothness assumptions
that many practical Maxent models lack. In this paper, we present novel
optimization algorithms that overcome the shortcomings of state-of-the-art
algorithms for training large-scale, non-smooth Maxent models. Our proposed
first-order algorithms leverage the Kullback-Leibler divergence to train
large-scale and non-smooth Maxent models efficiently. For Maxent models with
discrete probability distribution of $n$ elements built from samples, each
containing $m$ features, the stepsize parameters estimation and iterations in
our algorithms scale on the order of $O(mn)$ operations and can be trivially
parallelized. Moreover, the strong $\ell_{1}$ convexity of the
Kullback--Leibler divergence allows for larger stepsize parameters, thereby
speeding up the convergence rate of our algorithms. To illustrate the
efficiency of our novel algorithms, we consider the problem of estimating
probabilities of fire occurrences as a function of ecological features in the
Western US MTBS-Interagency wildfire data set. Our numerical results show that
our algorithms outperform the state of the arts by one order of magnitude and
yield results that agree with physical models of wildfire occurrence and
previous statistical analyses of wildfire drivers.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06816v1'>2403.06816v1</a></div>

recurrent under mild assumptions. In this work, we show that for a particular
class of stochastic optimization algorithms, we do not need any other property

Furthermore, the implied constant depends explicitly on the `speed of

isoperimetric condition, Huang et al. (2023) proposed to perform sampling
through reverse diffusion, giving rise to Diffusion-based Monte Carlo (DMC).
Specifically, DMC follows the reverse SDE of a diffusion process that
transforms the target distribution to the standard Gaussian, utilizing a
non-parametric score estimation. However, the original DMC algorithm
encountered high gradient complexity, resulting in an exponential dependency on
the error tolerance $\epsilon$ of the obtained samples. In this paper, we
demonstrate that the high complexity of DMC originates from its redundant
design of score estimation, and proposed a more efficient algorithm, called
RS-DMC, based on a novel recursive score estimation method. In particular, we
first divide the entire diffusion process into multiple segments and then
formulate the score estimation step (at any time step) as a series of
interconnected mean estimation and sampling subproblems accordingly, which are
correlated in a recursive manner. Importantly, we show that with a proper
design of the segment decomposition, all sampling subproblems will only need to
tackle a strongly log-concave distribution, which can be very efficient to
solve using the Langevin-based samplers with a provably rapid convergence rate.
As a result, we prove that the gradient complexity of RS-DMC only has a
quasi-polynomial dependency on $\epsilon$, which significantly improves
exponential gradient complexity in Huang et al. (2023). Furthermore, under
commonly used dissipative conditions, our algorithm is provably much faster

is the assumed access to samples that generate a Monte Carlo score estimator.
Then we provide an implementation of this oracle, based on rejection sampling,

The generative dynamics, starting from pure noise, encounters first a
'speciation' transition where the gross structure of data is unraveled, through
a mechanism similar to symmetry breaking in phase transitions. It is followed
at later time by a 'collapse' transition where the trajectories of the dynamics
become attracted to one of the memorized data points, through a mechanism which
is similar to the condensation in a glass phase. For any dataset, the
speciation time can be found from a spectral analysis of the correlation
matrix, and the collapse time can be found from the estimation of an 'excess
entropy' in the data. The dependence of the collapse time on the dimension and
number of data provides a thorough characterization of the curse of
dimensionality for diffusion models. Analytical solutions for simple models

applications such as predicting electronic structures in quantum chemistry, the
properties of condensed matter systems, and the behaviors of complex materials.
However, the real-time evolution of non-equilibrium quantum electronic systems
poses a significant challenge for theoretical and computational approaches, due
to the system's exploration of a vast configuration space. This work introduces
a variational approach for fermionic time-dependent wave functions, surpassing
mean-field approximations by capturing many-body correlations. The proposed
methodology involves parameterizing the time-evolving quantum state, enabling
the approximation of the state's evolution. To account for electron
correlations, we employ time-dependent Jastrow factors and backflow
transformations. We also show that we can incorporate neural networks to
parameterize these functions. The time-dependent variational Monte Carlo
technique is employed to efficiently compute the optimal time-dependent
parameters. The approach is demonstrated in three distinct systems: the
solvable harmonic interaction model, the dynamics of a diatomic molecule in
intense laser fields, and a quenched quantum dot. In all cases, we show clear
signatures of many-body correlations in the dynamics not captured by mean-field
methods. The results showcase the ability of our variational approach to
accurately capture the time evolution of quantum states, providing insight into
the quantum dynamics of interacting electronic systems, beyond the capabilities
of mean-field.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07447v1'>2403.07447v1</a></div>

standard stochastic optimization methods, while their Riemannian counterparts

construct a stochastic differential equation (SDE) to approximate the discrete

models, a powerful generative AI technology, and investigate their potential
for black-box optimization over complex structured variables. Consider the
practical scenario where one wants to optimize some structured design in a
high-dimensional space, based on massive unlabeled data (representing design
variables) and a small labeled dataset. We study two practical types of labels:
1) noisy measurements of a real-valued reward function and 2) human preference
based on pairwise comparisons. The goal is to generate new designs that are
near-optimal and preserve the designed latent structures. Our proposed method
reformulates the design optimization problem into a conditional sampling
problem, which allows us to leverage the power of diffusion models for modeling
complex distributions. In particular, we propose a reward-directed conditional
diffusion model, to be trained on the mixed data, for sampling a near-optimal
solution conditioned on high predicted rewards. Theoretically, we establish
sub-optimality error bounds for the generated designs. The sub-optimality gap
nearly matches the optimal guarantee in off-policy bandits, demonstrating the
efficiency of reward-directed diffusion models for black-box optimization.
Moreover, when the data admits a low-dimensional latent subspace structure, our
model efficiently generates high-fidelity designs that closely respect the
latent structure. We provide empirical experiments validating our model in
decision-making and content-creation tasks.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13219v1'>2403.13219v1</a></div>

networks of users. In the proposed scenario, users contain a local dataset and
communicate only with their immediate neighbours, with the aim of finding a
clustering of the full, joint data. The proposed family, termed Distributed
Gradient Clustering (DGC-$\mathcal{F}_\rho$), is parametrized by $\rho \geq 1$,
controling the proximity of users' center estimates, with $\mathcal{F}$
determining the clustering loss. Specialized to popular clustering losses like
$K$-means and Huber loss, DGC-$\mathcal{F}_\rho$ gives rise to novel
distributed clustering algorithms DGC-KM$_\rho$ and DGC-HL$_\rho$, while a
novel clustering loss based on the logistic function leads to DGC-LL$_\rho$. We
provide a unified analysis and establish several strong results, under mild
assumptions. First, the sequence of centers generated by the methods converges
to a well-defined notion of fixed point, under any center initialization and
value of $\rho$. Second, as $\rho$ increases, the family of fixed points
produced by DGC-$\mathcal{F}_\rho$ converges to a notion of consensus fixed
points. We show that consensus fixed points of DGC-$\mathcal{F}_{\rho}$ are
equivalent to fixed points of gradient clustering over the full data,
guaranteeing a clustering of the full data is produced. For the special case of
Bregman losses, we show that our fixed points converge to the set of Lloyd
points. Numerical experiments on real data confirm our theoretical findings and
demonstrate strong performance of the methods.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01302v1'>2402.01302v1</a></div>

leverages the Laplace approximation and change of kernel technique to transform

extending existing works that often focus on specific link functions or

advantageous when the ensemble size is considerably smaller than the inference

data-driven ABCD method to improve it and to generalize it using Bayesian
Machine Learning tools. We propose that a dataset consisting of a signal and
many backgrounds is well described through a mixture model. Signal, backgrounds
and their relative fractions in the sample can be well extracted by exploiting
the prior knowledge and the dependence between the different observables at the
event-by-event level with Bayesian tools. We show how, in contrast to the ABCD
method, one can take advantage of understanding some properties of the
different backgrounds and of having more than two independent observables to
measure in each event. In addition, instead of regions defined through hard
cuts, the Bayesian framework uses the information of continuous distribution to
obtain soft-assignments of the events which are statistically more robust. To
compare both methods we use a toy problem inspired by $pp\to hh\to b\bar b b
\bar b$, selecting a reduced and simplified number of processes and analysing
the flavor of the four jets and the invariant mass of the jet-pairs, modeled
with simplified distributions. Taking advantage of all this information, and
starting from a combination of biased and agnostic priors, leads us to a very
good posterior once we use the Bayesian framework to exploit the data and the
mutual information of the observables at the event-by-event level. We show how,
in this simplified model, the Bayesian framework outperforms the ABCD method

mostly on state estimation, however can have difficulty learning the parameters
accurately. On the other hand, machine learning based approaches can naturally
learn the state and parameters, but their applicability can be limited, or
produce uncertainties that are hard to interpret. Inspired by the Integrated
Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) method in spatial statistics, we propose an
alternative approach to DA based on iteratively linearising the dynamical
model. This produces a Gaussian Markov random field at each iteration, enabling
one to use INLA to infer the state and parameters. Our approach can be used for
arbitrary nonlinear systems, while retaining interpretability, and is
furthermore demonstrated to outperform existing methods on the DA task. By
providing a more nuanced approach to handling nonlinear PDE priors, our
methodology offers improved accuracy and robustness in predictions, especially
where data sparsity is prevalent.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17036v1'>2402.17036v1</a></div>

rare-event algorithm called Trajectory-Adaptive Multilevel Splitting (TAMS).
However, the efficiency and accuracy of TAMS depend on the choice of the score
function. Although the definition of the optimal score function, called
``committor function" is known, it is impossible in general to compute it a

those in the literature where a physically-informed score function was used. We
show that coupling a rare-event algorithm with machine learning allows for a
correct estimation of transition probabilities, transition times, and even
transition paths for a wide range of model parameters. We then extend these

to perform optimization within the data manifold using diffusion models. To
constrain the optimization process to the data manifold, we reformulate the

distribution learned by the diffusion model. To enhance sampling efficiency, we
propose a two-stage framework that begins with a guided diffusion process for
warm-up, followed by a Langevin dynamics stage for further correction.
Theoretical analysis shows that the initial stage results in a distribution
focused on feasible solutions, thereby providing a better initialization for

recover a stochastic process transporting the mass between distributions given
only a transport plan between them. In particular, given the EOT plan, these
procedures can be adapted to solve SB. This fact is heavily exploited by recent
works giving rives to matching-based SB solvers. The cornerstone here is
recovering the EOT plan: recent works either use heuristical approximations
(e.g., the minibatch OT) or establish iterative matching procedures which by
the design accumulate the error during the training. We address these

problem when the number of model dimensions $p$ is much larger than the number
of samples $n$. However, there has been little work that studies sparse basis
recovery in the Federated Learning (FL) setting, where the client data's
differential privacy (DP) must also be simultaneously protected. In particular,
the performance guarantees of existing DP-FL algorithms (such as DP-SGD) will
degrade significantly when $p \gg n$, and thus, they will fail to learn the
true underlying sparse model accurately. In this work, we develop a new
differentially private sparse basis recovery algorithm for the FL setting,
called SPriFed-OMP. SPriFed-OMP converts OMP (Orthogonal Matching Pursuit) to
the FL setting. Further, it combines SMPC (secure multi-party computation) and
DP to ensure that only a small amount of noise needs to be added in order to
achieve differential privacy. As a result, SPriFed-OMP can efficiently recover
the true sparse basis for a linear model with only $n = O(\sqrt{p})$ samples.
We further present an enhanced version of our approach, SPriFed-OMP-GRAD based
on gradient privatization, that improves the performance of SPriFed-OMP. Our
theoretical analysis and empirical results demonstrate that both SPriFed-OMP
and SPriFed-OMP-GRAD terminate in a small number of steps, and they
significantly outperform the previous state-of-the-art DP-FL solutions in terms
of the accuracy-privacy trade-off.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19016v1'>2402.19016v1</a></div>

large loss in utility. This paper presents a new approach to evaluate the

provides a strong worst-case guarantee that no membership inference attack
(MIA) can succeed at determining whether a person's data was used to train a
machine learning model. The guarantee of DP is worst-case because: a) it holds
even if the attacker already knows the records of all but one person in the
data set; and b) it holds uniformly over all data sets. In practical
applications, such a worst-case guarantee may be overkill: practical attackers
may lack exact knowledge of (nearly all of) the private data, and our data set
might be easier to defend, in some sense, than the worst-case data set. Such
considerations have motivated the industrial deployment of DP models with large
privacy parameter (e.g. $\epsilon \geq 7$), and it has been observed
empirically that DP with large $\epsilon$ can successfully defend against
state-of-the-art MIAs. Existing DP theory cannot explain these empirical
findings: e.g., the theoretical privacy guarantees of $\epsilon \geq 7$ are
essentially vacuous. In this paper, we aim to close this gap between theory and
practice and understand why a large DP parameter can prevent practical MIAs. To
tackle this problem, we propose a new privacy notion called practical
membership privacy (PMP). PMP models a practical attacker's uncertainty about
the contents of the private data. The PMP parameter has a natural
interpretation in terms of the success rate of a practical MIA on a given data
set. We quantitatively analyze the PMP parameter of two fundamental DP
mechanisms: the exponential mechanism and Gaussian mechanism. Our analysis
reveals that a large DP parameter often translates into a much smaller PMP
parameter, which guarantees strong privacy against practical MIAs. Using our
findings, we offer principled guidance for practitioners in choosing the DP

political and religious preferences. Differentially private publication
mechanisms have been proposed to allow for analyses under rigorous privacy
guarantees. However, the traditional protection schemes suffer from a limiting
privacy-utility trade-off and are vulnerable to correlation and reconstruction
attacks. Synthetic trajectory data generation and release represent a promising
alternative to protection algorithms. While initial proposals achieve
remarkable utility, they fail to provide rigorous privacy guarantees. This
paper proposes a framework for designing a privacy-preserving trajectory
publication approach by defining five design goals, particularly stressing the
importance of choosing an appropriate Unit of Privacy. Based on this framework,
we briefly discuss the existing trajectory protection approaches, emphasising
their shortcomings. This work focuses on the systematisation of the
state-of-the-art generative models for trajectories in the context of the
proposed framework. We find that no existing solution satisfies all

applicability of six sequential generative models to the trajectory domain.
Finally, we conclude that a generative trajectory model providing semantic

Initially, we provide studies affirming the current privacy analysis is indeed

harder than improper learning. In the classical case, there are examples of
concept classes with VC dimension $d$ that have sample complexity
$\Omega\left(\frac d\epsilon\log\frac1\epsilon\right)$ for proper learning with
error $\epsilon$, while the complexity for improper learning is O$\!\left(\frac
d\epsilon\right)$. One such example arises from the Coupon Collector problem.
  Motivated by the efficiency of proper versus improper learning with quantum
samples, Arunachalam, Belovs, Childs, Kothari, Rosmanis, and de Wolf (TQC 2020)
studied an analogue, the Quantum Coupon Collector problem. Curiously, they
discovered that for learning size $k$ subsets of $[n]$ the problem has sample
complexity $\Theta(k\log\min\{k,n-k+1\})$, in contrast with the complexity of
$\Theta(k\log k)$ for Coupon Collector. This effectively negates the
possibility of a separation between the two modes of learning via the quantum
problem, and Arunachalam et al.\ posed the possibility of such a separation as
an open question.
  In this work, we first present an algorithm for the Quantum Coupon Collector
problem with sample complexity that matches the sharper lower bound of
$(1-o_k(1))k\ln\min\{k,n-k+1\}$ shown recently by Bab Hadiashar, Nayak, and
Sinha (IEEE TIT 2024), for the entire range of the parameter $k$. Next, we
devise a variant of the problem, the Quantum Padded Coupon Collector. We prove
that its sample complexity matches that of the classical Coupon Collector
problem for both modes of learning, thereby exhibiting the same asymptotic
separation between proper and improper quantum learning as mentioned above. The
techniques we develop in the process can be directly applied to any form of
padded quantum data. We hope that padding can more generally lift other forms
of classical learning behaviour to the quantum setting.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03295v1'>2403.03295v1</a></div>

recently proposed by B{\l}asiok, Gopalan, Hu and Nakkiran (STOC 2023) for the
offline setting. The calibration distance is a natural and intuitive measure of
deviation from perfect calibration, and satisfies a Lipschitz continuity
property which does not hold for many popular calibration measures, such as the
$L_1$ calibration error and its variants.
  We prove that there is a forecasting algorithm that achieves an $O(\sqrt{T})$
calibration distance in expectation on an adversarially chosen sequence of $T$
binary outcomes. At the core of this upper bound is a structural result showing
that the calibration distance is accurately approximated by the lower
calibration distance, which is a continuous relaxation of the former. We then
show that an $O(\sqrt{T})$ lower calibration distance can be achieved via a
simple minimax argument and a reduction to online learning on a Lipschitz

  On the lower bound side, an $\Omega(T^{1/3})$ calibration distance is shown
to be unavoidable, even when the adversary outputs a sequence of independent
random bits, and has an additional ability to early stop (i.e., to stop

important to control the real-time false coverage-statement rate (FCR) to
measure the averaged miscoverage error. We develop a general framework named
CAS (Calibration after Adaptive Selection) that can wrap around any prediction
model and online selection rule to output post-selection prediction intervals.
If the current individual is selected, we first perform an adaptive selection
on historical data to construct a calibration set, then output a conformal
prediction interval for the unobserved label. We provide tractable
constructions for the calibration set for popular online selection rules. We
proved that CAS can achieve an exact selection-conditional coverage guarantee

exactly control the real-time FCR below the target level without any

Markov decision processes (MDPs) under sequential ignorability: They have been
shown to converge as $1/\sqrt{T}$ with the horizon $T$, to be statistically
efficient in large samples, and to allow for modular implementation where
preliminary estimation tasks can be executed using standard reinforcement
learning techniques. Existing results, however, make heavy use of a strong
distributional overlap assumption whereby the stationary distributions of the
target policy and the data-collection policy are within a bounded factor of
each other -- and this assumption is typically only credible when the state
space of the MDP is bounded. In this paper, we re-visit the task of off-policy
evaluation in MDPs under a weaker notion of distributional overlap, and
introduce a class of truncated doubly robust (TDR) estimators which we find to
perform well in this setting. When the distribution ratio of the target and
data-collection policies is square-integrable (but not necessarily bounded),
our approach recovers the large-sample behavior previously established under
strong distributional overlap. When this ratio is not square-integrable, TDR is
still consistent but with a slower-than-$1/\sqrt{T}$; furthermore, this rate of
convergence is minimax over a class of MDPs defined only using mixing

$\tilde{O}\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon^{2p}(1-\gamma)^{2p+1}}\right)$ iterations
to achieve an $\varepsilon$-optimal estimator with high probability, when the
estimation error is measured by the $p$-Wasserstein distance. This sample
complexity bound is minimax optimal (up to logarithmic factors) in the case of

with a fine-grained variance-aware confidence set, where the variance is
estimated recursively from high-order moments. Our algorithm achieves an
$\tilde{\mathcal O}(dB_*\sqrt{K})$ regret bound, where $d$ is the dimension of
the feature mapping in the linear transition kernel, $B_*$ is the upper bound
of the total cumulative cost for the optimal policy, and $K$ is the number of
episodes. Our regret upper bound matches the $\Omega(dB_*\sqrt{K})$ lower bound
of linear mixture SSPs in Min et al. (2022), which suggests that our algorithm
is nearly minimax optimal.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08998v1'>2402.08998v1</a></div>

Traditionally, it focuses on the setting where you can arbitrarily query the
search space. However, many real-life problems do not offer this flexibility;
in particular, the search space of the next query may depend on previous ones.
Example challenges arise in the physical sciences in the form of local movement
constraints, required monotonicity in certain variables, and transitions
influencing the accuracy of measurements. Altogether, such transition
constraints necessitate a form of planning. This work extends Bayesian
optimization via the framework of Markov Decision Processes, iteratively
solving a tractable linearization of our objective using reinforcement learning
to obtain a policy that plans ahead over long horizons. The resulting policy is
potentially history-dependent and non-Markovian. We showcase applications in

dealing with non-stationary environments, where exogenous environmental
conditions change over time. Such problems are traditionally modeled as
non-stationary Markov decision processes (NSMDP). However, existing approaches
for decision-making in NSMDPs have two major shortcomings: first, they assume
that the updated environmental dynamics at the current time are known (although
future dynamics can change); and second, planning is largely pessimistic, i.e.,
the agent acts ``safely'' to account for the non-stationary evolution of the
environment. We argue that both these assumptions are invalid in practice --
updated environmental conditions are rarely known, and as the agent interacts
with the environment, it can learn about the updated dynamics and avoid being
pessimistic, at least in states whose dynamics it is confident about. We
present a heuristic search algorithm called \textit{Adaptive Monte Carlo Tree
Search (ADA-MCTS)} that addresses these challenges. We show that the agent can
learn the updated dynamics of the environment over time and then act as it
learns, i.e., if the agent is in a region of the state space about which it has
updated knowledge, it can avoid being pessimistic. To quantify ``updated
knowledge,'' we disintegrate the aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in the
agent's updated belief and show how the agent can use these estimates for
decision-making. We compare the proposed approach with the multiple
state-of-the-art approaches in decision-making across multiple well-established
open-source problems and empirically show that our approach is faster and
highly adaptive without sacrificing safety.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01841v3'>2401.01841v3</a></div>

strategies: pre-planning strategy which injects safety knowledge to the model
prior to plan generation, in-planning strategy which bolsters safety during
plan generation, and post-planning strategy which ensures safety by

to provide bounded policy error guarantees over an infinite range of initial
states for many DC-MDPs with expressive nonlinear dynamics, but it can also
provably derive optimal policies in cases where it terminates with zero error.
Furthermore, CGPO can generate worst-case state trajectories to diagnose policy
deficiencies and provide counterfactual explanations of optimal actions. To
achieve such results, CGPO proposes a bi-level mixed-integer nonlinear
optimization framework for optimizing policies within defined expressivity
classes (i.e. piecewise (non)-linear) and reduces it to an optimal constraint
generation methodology that adversarially generates worst-case state

inefficiency, hindering their practical applications. This inefficiency stems
from two main facts: a focus on tail-end performance that overlooks many
sampled trajectories, and the potential of gradient vanishing when the lower
tail of the return distribution is overly flat. To address these challenges, we
propose a simple mixture policy parameterization. This method integrates a
risk-neutral policy with an adjustable policy to form a risk-averse policy. By
employing this strategy, all collected trajectories can be utilized for policy
updating, and the issue of vanishing gradients is counteracted by stimulating
higher returns through the risk-neutral component, thus lifting the tail and

delays has been extensively studied for optimization, the manner in which they
interact with the underlying Markov process to shape the finite-time
performance of SA remains poorly understood. In this context, our first main
contribution is to show that under time-varying bounded delays, the delayed SA
update rule guarantees exponentially fast convergence of the \emph{last
iterate} to a ball around the SA operator's fixed point. Notably, our bound is
\emph{tight} in its dependence on both the maximum delay $\tau_{max}$, and the
mixing time $\tau_{mix}$. To achieve this tight bound, we develop a novel
inductive proof technique that, unlike various existing delayed-optimization
analyses, relies on establishing uniform boundedness of the iterates. As such,
our proof may be of independent interest. Next, to mitigate the impact of the
maximum delay on the convergence rate, we provide the first finite-time
analysis of a delay-adaptive SA scheme under Markovian sampling. In particular,
we show that the exponent of convergence of this scheme gets scaled down by
$\tau_{avg}$, as opposed to $\tau_{max}$ for the vanilla delayed SA rule; here,
$\tau_{avg}$ denotes the average delay across all iterations. Moreover, the
adaptive scheme requires no prior knowledge of the delay sequence for step-size

A notable unresolved query in stochastic processes is learning mixtures of
continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs). While there is progress in learning
mixtures of discrete-time Markov chains with recovery guarantees
[GKV16,ST23,KTT2023], the continuous scenario uncovers unique unexplored
challenges. The intrigue in CTMC mixtures stems from their potential to model
intricate continuous-time stochastic processes prevalent in various fields
including social media, finance, and biology.
  In this study, we introduce a novel framework for exploring CTMCs,
emphasizing the influence of observed trails' length and mixture parameters on
problem regimes, which demands specific algorithms. Through thorough
experimentation, we examine the impact of discretizing continuous-time trails
on the learnability of the continuous-time mixture, given that these processes
are often observed via discrete, resource-demanding observations. Our
comparative analysis with leading methods explores sample complexity and the
trade-off between the number of trails and their lengths, offering crucial
insights for method selection in different problem instances. We apply our
algorithms on an extensive collection of Lastfm's user-generated trails
spanning three years, demonstrating the capability of our algorithms to
differentiate diverse user preferences. We pioneer the use of CTMC mixtures on
a basketball passing dataset to unveil intricate offensive tactics of NBA

altering the set of optimal policies. Testing in the MiniGrid DoorKey and Cliff
Walking environments, we demonstrate that PBIM successfully prevents the agent
from converging to a suboptimal policy and can speed up training.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07411v1'>2402.07411v1</a></div>

promising applications of autonomous robotic systems. Recent studies have
reported encouraging results using deep reinforcement learning (RL) in the
healthcare domain. Previous studies showed that assistive tasks can be
formulated as multi-agent RL, wherein there are two agents: a caregiver and a
care-receiver. However, policies trained in multi-agent RL are often sensitive
to the policies of other agents. In such a case, a trained caregiver's policy
may not work for different care-receivers. To alleviate this issue, we propose
a framework that learns a robust caregiver's policy by training it for diverse
care-receiver responses. In our framework, diverse care-receiver responses are
autonomously learned through trials and errors. In addition, to robustify the
care-giver's policy, we propose a strategy for sampling a care-receiver's
response in an adversarial manner during the training. We evaluated the
proposed method using tasks in an Assistive Gym. We demonstrate that policies
trained with a popular deep RL method are vulnerable to changes in policies of
other agents and that the proposed framework improves the robustness against
such changes.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00344v1'>2403.00344v1</a></div>

<div id='2401.10941v1' style='display: none; margin-left: 20px'><div>Date: 2024-01-17T18:06:17Z</div><div>Authors: David Chhan, Ellen Novoseller, Vernon J. Lawhern</div><div style='padding-top: 10px; width: 80ex'>Preference-based reinforcement learning (RL) provides a framework to train
agents using human feedback through pairwise preferences over pairs of
behaviors, enabling agents to learn desired behaviors when it is difficult to
specify a numerical reward function. While this paradigm leverages human
feedback, it currently treats the feedback as given by a single human user.
Meanwhile, incorporating preference feedback from crowds (i.e. ensembles of
users) in a robust manner remains a challenge, and the problem of training RL
agents using feedback from multiple human users remains understudied. In this
work, we introduce Crowd-PrefRL, a framework for performing preference-based RL
leveraging feedback from crowds. This work demonstrates the viability of
learning reward functions from preference feedback provided by crowds of
unknown expertise and reliability. Crowd-PrefRL not only robustly aggregates
the crowd preference feedback, but also estimates the reliability of each user
within the crowd using only the (noisy) crowdsourced preference comparisons.
Most importantly, we show that agents trained with Crowd-PrefRL outperform
agents trained with majority-vote preferences or preferences from any
individual user in most cases, especially when the spread of user error rates
among the crowd is large. Results further suggest that our method can identify
minority viewpoints within the crowd.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10941v1'>2401.10941v1</a></div>

for many applications. However, since most of the literature in the field is
currently focused on opaque models, the use of RL in high-stakes scenarios,
where interpretability is crucial, is still limited. Recently, some approaches
to interpretable RL, e.g., based on Decision Trees, have been proposed, but one
of the main limitations of these techniques is their training cost. To overcome
this limitation, we propose a new population-based method, called Social
Interpretable RL (SIRL), inspired by social learning principles, to improve
learning efficiency. Our method mimics a social learning process, where each
agent in a group learns to solve a given task based both on its own individual
experience as well as the experience acquired together with its peers. Our
approach is divided into two phases. In the \emph{collaborative phase}, all the
agents in the population interact with a shared instance of the environment,
where each agent observes the state and independently proposes an action. Then,
voting is performed to choose the action that will actually be performed in the
environment. In the \emph{individual phase}, each agent refines its individual
performance by interacting with its own instance of the environment. This
mechanism makes the agents experience a larger number of episodes while
simultaneously reducing the computational cost of the process. Our results on
six well-known benchmarks show that SIRL reaches state-of-the-art performance
w.r.t. the alternative interpretable methods from the literature.</div><div><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15480v1'>2401.15480v1</a></div>
