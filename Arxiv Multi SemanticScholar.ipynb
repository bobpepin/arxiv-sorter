In such a system\\, a NN controller\\\\nprocesses images from a camera to guide the aircraft while approaching the\\\\nrunway\\. A central challenge for the safety and liveness verification of\\\\nvision\\-based closed\\-loop systems is the lack of mathematical models that\\\\ncaptures the relation between the system states \\(e\\.g\\.\\, position of the\\\\naircraft\\) and the images processed by the vision\\-based NN controller\\. Another\\\\nchallenge is the limited abilities of state\\-of\\-the\\-art NN model checkers\\. Such\\\\nmodel checkers can reason only about simple input\\-output robustness properties\\\\nof neural networks\\.

To this\\\\nend\\, this paper presents NNLander\\-VeriF\\, a framework to verify vision\\-based NN\\\\ncontrollers used for autonomous landing\\.

By converting this model into a NN\\\\n\\(with manually assigned weights\\) and composing it with the NN controller\\, one\\\\ncan capture the relation between aircraft states and control actions using one\\\\naugmented NN\\. Such an augmented NN model leads to a natural encoding of the\\\\nclosed\\-loop verification into several NN robustness queries\\, which\\\\nstate\\-of\\-the\\-art NN model checkers can handle\\.
